ABSTRACT
This article proposes a demonstration implementing the data mini-
mization privacy principle, focusing on reducing data collected by
government administrations through forms. Data minimization is
defined in many privacy regulations worldwide, but has not seen ex-
tensive real-world application. We propose a model based on logic
and game theory and show that it is possible to create a practical
and efficient solution for a real French welfare benefit case.

1 INTRODUCTION
Overview. In this demonstration, we propose a tool to assist users
with the problem of the minimization of personal data collected in
the context of administrative forms. Data minimization is a funda-
mental privacy concept defined in many privacy regulations (such
as the European General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR [7])
that states that only the data necessary to take a decision must be
collected and stored. Data minimization has yet to see any kind of
large scale (non trivial) implementation. We have recently proposed
in [2] a model, based on propositional logic and game theory, to
capture the general problem of data minimization. We propose to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach on real forms.

General Context. Forms are filled by individuals who wish to
apply for welfare benefits (e.g. in France). The volume of personal
data thus collected is massive and concerns millions of individu-
als. For example, hundreds of different types of aids are offered
in France at local or national level, to meet different social needs
or provide incentives, with a very large number of beneficiaries.
This includes aid for family, education, savings, access to housing,
health, transport, mobility, energy saving, legal aid, etc. Govern-
mental portals offer simulators so that citizens can identify the
aids they can apply for. For example, aide-sociale.fr offers a rather
holistic simulator (more than 1000 aids); the governmental portal
mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr is targeted on the most solicited aids (58
welfare aids) and also offers a simulator for young adults (887 aids).
In order to be obtained, each proposed aid requires the beneficiary
to fill out a form to collect their personal data showing that they
meet the eligibility criteria and calibrating the aid. The allocation
decision is made based on the collected data, which leads to the
processing of millions of forms per year, with several weeks of
instruction by the administration. For example, the public data set
provided by the French government indicates that 6 million forms
per year were processed on average over the period 2016-2020 for
only 10 family welfare benefits. As another example, the social aid
benefit related to "complementary health coverage" (which is one
of those we propose to demonstrate) concerns 7.19 million bene-
ficiaries in 2022 (see annual report of the complementary health
insurance on p.10), all of whom had to send in their corresponding
form to activate and subsequently renew the aid each year (see
same report at bottom of p.8).

Objective. Given these staggering numbers, an effective solution
to minimize data collected via forms, while properly informing the
individual and obtaining their informed consent to the collection
process, may lead to significant resource gains and more rigorous
compliance with legal principles [6, 7]. We will show in this demon-
stration a PET (Privacy Enhancing Technology) which analyzes
a given user’s data, proposes all possible data minimizations, and
quantifies the information that will subsequently be sent by the
user, in order to let them make an informed decision on which
minimization to choose.

2 DATA MINIMIZATION RELATED WORK
Data minimization prior to processing has long been considered an
unsolvable problem [13], with an overly negative influence on the
quality of the processing [5], sometimes in contradiction with other

CCS ’23, November 26–30, 2023, Copenhagen, Denmark

legal obligations such as discrimination prevention [9], fairness [10]
or fraud detection [8]. Implementation is deemed too complicated
for developers [1, 11], which has led to an overall limited adoption
and compliance with this principle. Some barriers were removed by
the introduction of a formalism clarifying the general objectives of
a data minimizer [3]. Indeed, recent contributions show that such a
formalism can be applied in the context of using machine learning
to predict recommendations/personalization through performance
metrics [4, 12], while minimizing the data taken as input and still
producing a useful model as output, even though its quality is
slightly reduced. In [2], we study the case of administrative forms,
where such a trade-off between data minimization (or privacy) and
performance (utility of the processing) does not apply. Indeed the
full range of benefits due to individuals must be offered by virtue
of law: any metric that reduces the legitimate benefits due to a user
in exchange for better data minimization would not be acceptable.
Moreover, using logic and game theory, we show how to bring
meaningful information to the individual in order to obtain their
informed consent on the collection process, which is also required
by regulations. This demonstration is based on this last result. We
explain our approach on an example in the following section, which
will be used in the demonstration.

3 A DATA MINIMIZATION EXAMPLE

The RSA benefit. In this section, we walk the reader through our
approach, using the "active solidarity income" (in French: "revenu
de solidarité active", abbreviated as RSA) welfare benefit form. The
volume of RSA requests is around 2 million forms processed per
year1 for a total spending of around 12 billion euros, which is the
highest welfare benefit (in term of euros spent) in France. Note that
our demonstration will feature the RSA, but also the complementary
health coverage aids which is the welfare benefit with the most
forms processed annually in France (over 7 million forms) for a total
spending of around 2.8 billion euros, as detailed in [2]. We believe
these examples show that our approach can be used to manage
real large scale use cases, and that there is a real impact on 1) the
minimization of data sent and 2) the quantification of the data sent,
thus improving the users information with a view to consent.

General approach. We consider an automatic decision making sys-
tem, which processes user data, collected as a form of attribute/value
pairs (e.g. 𝑎𝑔𝑒 = 25 or 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒). We assume that the auto-
matic decision making system uses logical rules, which we write
in disjunctive normal form (DNF) (e.g. a disjunction of conjunc-
tions, each conjunction representing one possibility of obtaining a
benefit). This is the case of many classical AI approaches such as
decision trees, which benefit from explainability. By considering
the values of all a given user’s attributes, we deduce the predicates
triggered by the user.

Building the RSA form. The RSA example was built using data
from its official description2. 17 predicates are used, which are a
direct translation of the official texts, negations included :

𝑝1 : nationality = FRENCH

1See the Court of Auditors website, and for more details its recent report: "The Active
Solidarity Income", Evaluation of a public policy, Jan. 2022 (link to the report).
2See here for the official description (in French).

𝑝2 : nationality = EUROPEAN COUNTRY
𝑝3 : nationality = SWISS
𝑝4 : valid residence permit for at least 5 years = TRUE
𝑝5 : age ≥ 25
𝑝6 : pregnant = TRUE
𝑝7 : children > 0
𝑝8 : 18 ≤ age < 25
𝑝9 : working = TRUE
𝑝10 : living in France = TRUE
𝑝11 : single parent = TRUE
𝑝12 : High school student = FALSE
𝑝13 : Higher education student = FALSE
𝑝14 : Intern = FALSE
𝑝15 : on leave = FALSE
𝑝16 : sabbatical = FALSE
𝑝17 : non active status = FALSE

As some predicates are linked to each other, we add some consis-
tency rules, noted 𝑅𝐴𝐷𝐷 , as follow :

𝑝1 → 𝑝2 (if you are French you are from Europe)
𝑝1 → ¬𝑝4 (if you are French you do not have a green card)
𝑝4 → ¬𝑝1 (if you have a green card you are not french)
𝑝5 → ¬𝑝8 (if you are over 25, then you are not 18-25)
𝑝8 → ¬𝑝5 (if you are 18-25, then you are not over 25)
Eligibility criteria and benefits for RSA are outlined on the French
”Family Allowance Fund”. We directly translated the rules to a propo-
sitional formula, and then converted the formula to DNF using the
Logical Expression Converter program (Haskell code available here).
We then use a parser to transform this expression, and combine
it with 𝑅𝐴𝐷𝐷 to produce the DNF format used by our application
(which is a DNF version of the DIMACS CNF format3). The RSA.dnf
file is available here. It is composed of the 17 predicates and a dis-
junction of 31 conjunctions of up to 12 different predicates. An ex-
ample rule to obtain the benefit (e.g. the first of the 31 conjunctions)
states that one needs to be French (𝑝1), be over 25 years old (𝑝5), live
in France (𝑝10), be a single parent (𝑝11), and be neither conducting
an internship (𝑝14), a sabbatical (𝑝16) or non-active (𝑝17). The final
rule is obtained by adding the predicates triggered in 𝑅𝐴𝐷𝐷 , thus
the final rule is : 𝑝1 ∧𝑝2 ∧¬𝑝4 ∧𝑝5 ∧¬𝑝8 ∧𝑝10 ∧𝑝11 ∧𝑝14 ∧𝑝16 ∧𝑝17.

Computing the Minimal Accurate Subvaluations. We precom-
pute (offline) the Minimal Accurate Subvaluations (MAS) for all
possible forms that can obtain the benefit. MAS are a subset of the
17 predicates that correspond to enough information to grant the
benefit to a user, even if the user had multiple ways of obtaining
the benefit. These subvaluations are minimal in the sense that no
predicate can be removed while still granting the benefit to the user.
In this example, there are 1296 cases to consider, and 24 MAS. One
example of a MAS would be noted 𝑚1 = _1001__0_11___111 where
a 0 or 1 in a given position means the predicate must be revealed,
along with its value true (1) or false (0) and _ (blank) means the
predicate is not sent.

Linking MAS to forms. We next build a bipartite graph linking
each MAS to all the forms that it is a subvaluation of. It is possible
that a MAS is linked to several forms, and it is possible that a form
is linked to several MAS. If a form is only linked to one MAS, then

(1) Presentation/creation of the decision process. We have al-
ready analyzed 2 French administrative welfare benefit pro-
cedures (RSA and Welfare benefits). It is also possible for
participants to create their own decision process rules.
(2) Processing of the decision process rules (PET service for data
collection). This demonstrates the feasibility of our approach
on real world examples. Processing of the examples takes up
to a few minutes on a regular laptop. This process constructs
the MAS then generates the bipartite graph (Algo. 1) and
computes the payoff function using game theory (Algo. 2).
(3) Informed consent for users (Data collection service/GUI).
Participants are invited to fill in a form. The form is then
processed using the output of the previous service. Users
are suggested minimized forms, and are informed of the
corresponding payoff functions (i.e. number of other players
who share the same "blanked" form).

5 CONCLUSION
We introduced a novel Privacy Enhancing Technology for data min-
imization in administrative forms, informing eligible users about
data removal and its impact. This confirms data minimization’s
practicality in decision rule contexts.

a user with this form has no choice when minimizing their form,
they will need to send the MAS. If a form is linked to several MAS,
then the user may choose which MAS to send to the administration.

Choosing the MAS using game theory. In order to choose which
MAS to send, we need to define a cost function, for instance the
number of forms sending the MAS. We note this payoff function
𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑀 (𝑚) (Same MAS) where 𝑚 is a MAS. We use game theory to
compute the correct value of 𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑀 . The game is to decide which
MAS each player (a form) will send to the administration, and
the objective of the game is to send the MAS with the highest
𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑀 value. This is a one round game, all players announcing
simultaneously their move. We show in [2], Theorem 4.6 that this
game admits a Nash equilibrium (thus the moves of rational players
can be accurately predicted and computed), under a hypothesis on
lexicographical ordering of the MAS : all players with only one
choice play this choice, all players with equivalent choices will
play the first MAS in lexicographical order. Note that each player
reduces the value of 𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑀 (𝑚) for all the 𝑚 that the player could
have played, but in fact did not.

Example. Consider a user with the form (as in the demo video) : 𝑓 =
1100110111000111 (a 0 or 1 in a position means a false or true value
for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ predicate, bear in mind some are negative such as 𝑝15 =
𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒, which means the person is not on leave). This user has the
choice between 2 different MAS : 𝑚1 = _1001__0_11___111 which
corresponds to 32 other different forms or 𝑚2 = _100_1___11___111
which corresponds to 128 other different forms. Note that the num-
ber of different forms is less or equal to 2𝑏 where 𝑏 is the number
of blank predicates. Our informed consent minimizer thus informs
the user of this possible choice, and lets the user decide, suggesting
the better choice of 𝑚2
