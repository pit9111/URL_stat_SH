ABSTRACT
Personal Data Management System (PDMS) solutions are cur-
rently flourishing, spurred by new privacy regulations such as
GDPR and new legal concepts like data altruism. PDMSs aim
to empower individuals by providing appropriate tools to col-
lect and manage their personal data and share computed results
with third parties, thus requiring (i) a secure platform protect-
ing the user’s privacy and delivering strong guarantees on the
outputs of user’s data processing, and (ii) an extensible solution
that supports all types of data-driven computations. In previ-
ous works, we analyzed these requirements and proposed an
Extensive and Secure PDMS (ES-PDMS) logical architecture. This
demonstration presents the first ES-PDMS prototype based on
SGX enclaves, focusing on its security properties with the help
of several concrete scenarios and interactive games.

1 INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, successive steps have been taken to em-
power individuals with new legal means, from smart disclosure
initiatives in the US to the right to data portability [5] and the new
notion of data altruism enacted in the EU [4]. The ultimate goal
is to enable individuals to collect and share their personal infor-
mation and unlock innovative uses enabled by cross-exploiting
multiple personal data sources. The technical corollary is the
emergence of Personal Data Management Systems (PDMS) for
individuals, giving rise to PDMS products such as Digi.me, Cozy
Cloud, Personal Infomediaries [9], Solid/PODS [13], as well as
large initiatives like Mydata.org, supported by data protection
agencies.

Our in-depth analysis in [1] shows that the new PDMS para-
digm, which causes a shift of data and execution to the PDMS
owner’s side (the terms user or PDMS owner are used inter-
changeably hereafter), introduces specific –and conflicting– re-
quirements for extensiveness and security in data-oriented com-
putations. To exemplify this trend, we consider the Green bonus
scenario described below:

’Green bonus’ scenario: Companies want to reward their em-
ployees having an ecological conduct, and thus monthly compute
a green bonus (financial incentive) based on the number of com-
mutes by bike. Figure 1 proposes a possible, user centered, work-
flow: GPS traces are collected from a reliable service (e.g., Google
Maps), then processed locally (e.g., by the user’s PDMS) and the
result is delivered to the employer with a proof of compliance.

One specificity in this scenario is to call for mutual security be-
tween stakeholders (employees, i.e., PDMS users, and employers,
i.e., PDMS queriers): (i) privacy is needed to ensure employees
that their detailed location history is not disclosed to third par-
ties (including the employer); and (ii) verifiability must ensure
employers that the computed number of trips is faithful (e.g., a
reliable cloud service has provided the employee’s location his-
tory and a specific processing code was used to aggregate the
data). Finally, (iii) extensiveness is required, meaning that arbi-
trary –application specific– function code must be supported to
collect data (e.g., scrapper) and compute the results (e.g., compu-
tation goes beyond simple SQL and requires an extension of the
PDMS). Several similar scenarios are realistic, e.g., patients pro-
viding statistics to hospitals, privacy preserving power-meters,
pay-as-you-drive, etc.

Traditional solutions resorting to external services to perform
the data collection and/or computation would successfully en-
sure extensiveness and verifiability, but sharing personal data or
credentials raise privacy concerns and a perceived risk of mass
surveillance. On the other hand, existing PDMS products focus
on the extensiveness aspect with many data collectors and ap-
plications, but fall short in providing privacy and verifiability as
detailed in [1].

The recent democratization of Trusted Execution Environ-
ments (TEEs) at the user-side (e.g., Intel SGX [6] or ARM Trust-
Zone) opens new perspectives for secure computation in the
PDMS context [2]. A TEE provides hardware security based on
trusted enclaves, separated from the operating system and un-
trusted applications [6]. An enclave provides three properties: (i)
isolation ensures that the enclave code cannot be influenced by
an attacker; (ii) confidentiality ensures that the enclave data is
hidden from any other process by encrypting the RAM; (iii) with
attestation, the enclave can prove that its results were indeed
produced by its genuine code.

Several works have focused on new security models where
trust lies on the hardware rather than on the user environment.
For example, EnclaveDB [14], a TEE-based DBMS, could be a
building block for a PDMS ensuring privacy and verifiability

Designing an extensive and secure PDMS architecture preserving
usage with the guarantees defined above is a significant chal-
lenge, given the fundamental tension between security (small
trusted code base) and extensiveness (rich data-driven tasks).
In particular, the code extensions required to support advanced
-specific- data-oriented computations cannot be part of a trusted
code base for the PDMS. To solve this problem, we proposed in
[1] a three-layer logical architecture where Applications (Apps),
on which no security assumptions are made, communicate with
a minimal Secure Core (Core) implementing basic operations on
personal data, extended with Isolated Data Tasks (Data tasks), as
shown in Figure 2.

Secure Core. The Core is a secure subsystem that is a Trusted
Computing Base (TCB) ideally minimal, inextensible –potentially
proven correct through formal methods– and isolated from the
rest of the system. The Core provides all basic operations required
to enforce the confidentiality, integrity and resiliency of the per-
sonal data hosted by the PDMS and hence is trusted both by the
PDMS owner and by third parties that may access PDMS data.
It must be the unique entry point to manipulate this data. The
Core implements a data storage module, a policy enforcement
module to regulate the data access performed by the other layers
of the architecture, and a communication manager to securely
communicate with other users, applications and third parties.

Isolated Data Tasks. Data Tasks are introduced as a means
to support code extensions, needed to deal with application-
specific personal data management. Data Tasks can run arbitrary
application code, not necessarily trusted by the PDMS owner,
thereby enabling extensiveness (like UDFs in traditional DBMSs).
The idea is to control complex data-oriented tasks by (1) splitting
their execution into Data Tasks evaluated in a sufficiently isolated
environment to maintain control on the data accessed by the Core
and delivered to the Apps in order to avoid any side effect in terms
of data leaks, and (2) scheduling and verifying the execution of
Data Tasks by the Core such that security and privacy can be
globally enforced. Data processing pipelines may combine several
Data Tasks and require some security properties. The PDMS
must guarantee that the orchestration of these tasks cannot be
tampered with without the caller being able to detect it.

Untrusted Apps. Any developer should be able to develop
an application to ensure a wide and diverse application panel.
However, the complexity of these applications (large code base,
extensible and not proven) and their execution environment
(e.g., web browser) make them vulnerable. Therefore, no security
assumption is made on applications, which manipulate only au-
thorized data resulting from Data Tasks but have no privileges
on the raw data.

2.2 Architectural Security Properties
The specificity of our architecture is to remove from local or
remote Apps any sensitive data-oriented computation, delegating
it to Data Tasks running under the control of the Core at the user
side. Each App leverages one or several Data Tasks to execute
its computations, expressed as logical execution plans. The App
manifest includes essential information about the App and in
particular the execution plan and its security configuration (e.g.,
access control rules). It should be validated by e.g., a regulatory
agency or the App marketplace and approved by the PDMS owner
at the install time.

(adding appropriate access control and resorting to the TEE at-
testation capabilities [6]), but would fail to achieve extensibility.
Indeed, in the PDMS context the -potentially untrusted- compu-
tations “move” to the data at the user-side. A TEE-based PDMS
cannot simply be extended with traditional user-defined func-
tions (UDF), since UDFs are assumed to be checked by admins,
and thus, trusted, a too strong assumption in the PDMS context.
Other TEE-based DBMS architectures, like stealthDB [8], favor
extensibility by running large parts of the DBMS code outside
enclaves, but this implies an honest-but-curious attacker model,
considered unrealistic for user-side solutions.

Recent work on protecting query evaluation against side-
channels attacks on TEEs, e.g., oblivious data structures [15] or
differentially private techniques [12], is relevant to our proposal
but is considered orthogonal. Finally, sandboxing techniques
within enclaves (e.g., Ryoan [10], SGXJail [17]) protect the leak-
age of confidential data manipulated by untrusted enclaved code
by restricting its address space. However, to guarantee the global
security of the architecture combining trusted and untrusted
code, all the untrusted code must be totally separated from the
trusted computing base.

In this demonstration, we present our PDMS platform dealing
with the conflicting objectives of extensiveness and security in
the specific PDMS context, i.e., an ES-PDMS. Our platform is
based on the logical architecture we have proposed in [1] and
represents the first implementation of an ES-PDMS using SGX en-
claves. The originality of our approach is to achieve extensibility
through a set of isolated data-oriented tasks potentially untrusted
by the PDMS owner, running alongside a trusted module which
controls the complete workflow and limits data leakage [3]. The
objective of the demonstration is twofold1: (1) to enable interac-
tive visualization of the ES-PDMS secure workflow in different
real-world scenarios to show the importance of the proposed
security properties; (2) to demonstrate information leakage re-
duction in three attack scenarios through interactive games with
the audience. Before presenting our interactive demonstration
scenario in Section 3, we describe in Section 2 the architectural
properties introduced to enforce the PDMS security and minimize
data leakage.

2 EXTENSIVE AND SECURE PDMS
We introduce the architecture proposed in [1], present the secu-
rity properties allowing to reconcile extensiveness and security
and to minimize data leakage [3] and give some implementation
details.

rity properties that are transparent to the PDMS user, who is not
expected to be a security expert. Properties 1 to 5 are generic secu-
rity properties that must be properly orchestrated to strengthen
the security of our architecture. Security properties 6 to 8 were
designed for the specific ES-PDMS context and were introduced
in [3] along with a preliminary performance evaluation showing
moderate overheads (other works involving enclave database
management engines [14, 16] also attest acceptable overheads of
less than 40%). Section 3 presents execution scenarios exploiting
these properties.
P1. Enclaved Core/Data Tasks. The Core and each Data Task
run in individual enclaves protecting the data and code execution
confidentiality from the untrusted execution environment [6].
Besides, the code of each Data Task is sandboxed [10] within
its enclave to preclude any voluntary data leakage outside the
enclave by a malicious Data Task. The Apps run in the untrusted
execution environment (locally or remotely).
P2. Secure communications. All the communications are classi-
cally secured using TLS (see Section 2.4) to ensure authenticity, in-
tegrity and confidentiality. Compared with a typical client/server
setting, the overhead is limited to the establishment of additional
secure TLS channels between the Core and the Data Tasks (once
established, the cost is similar to inter-process communications).
P3. Core as proxy. In the specific case of data collection Tasks
requiring authentication to web services, the Core also plays the
role of a proxy opening the secure communication channel in
lieu of the Data Task. This way the connection credentials are fully
protected since this information is never revealed to the collect
Data Tasks. This ensures that the Core is the only entry/exit
point of the PDMS, while the Data Task never has direct access
to the “outside world”.
P4. End-to-end access control. The input/output of the Data
Tasks are regulated by the Core which enforces the access control
rules for each Task required by an App based on the policies
defined in the App manifest. For instance, a Data Task for col-
lecting GPS traces from a web service has only the privilege to
insert the collected data in the specified table (but cannot access
any other data). Similarly, a Data Task computing the number of
trips between two locations will only be supplied by the Core
with the necessary GPS traces and the two GPS positions. Finally,
the App only receives the final computation result from the Core
(i.e., the number of trips) without being able to access any other
data. This way the PDMS provides an end-to-end access control
at the App level.
P5. End-to-end attestations. Altogether, the previous security
properties result in an end-to-end attestation ensuring a third
party the verifiability of a computation. In our example, this is
done in three steps. First, P2 and P4 provide integrity for the GPS
traces given to the data collection Task (e.g., data is protected
against unauthorized updates from the PDMS owner). Second,
P1 and P3 certify that the final result (e.g., the number of bike
trips) is produced by an isolated enclave (the computation task)
acknowledged by the Core. Finally, the Core guarantees that the
global execution plan complies with the App manifest.

2.3 Limiting Leakage
Taken together, all the properties presented above enforce the
PDMS security and, in particular, the data confidentiality, preclud-
ing all the illegitimate data leakages except through the results
that are delivered by the Core to the Apps. This section discusses

more advanced properties specific to our three-layer architecture,
which allow to further reduce this potential data leakage channel.
P6. Limited result size. Since the only possible leakage channel
is through the final results the Apps receive from the Core, a
malicious Data Task may use it to leak private data, i.e., include
it within the bits codifying the result. Hence, the larger the result
size is, the greater the probability for an attacker to leak more
private data. A first measure that we propose is to limit the result
size to the minimum required value allowing a correct execution
of the computations (i.e., 𝑙𝑜𝑔2 (𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 (𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛(𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡)) bits). In our
example, the final results indicate the number of commutes by
bike during a month, thus the result size should be limited to
6 bits. The result size, indicated in the validated and approved
App manifest, is enforced by the Core before delivering any final
result.

Even with limited result size, a malicious task could still obtain
an important amount of private data over many computations. A
malicious Data task can exploit data persistence, keeping a “state”
between successive executions to maximize leakage. For instance,
a Data Task could select some GPS traces data from the input,
store it and progressively leak it over several executions while
retaining the past leaks to avoid leaking the same data twice.
P7. Stateless Data Tasks. To preclude such behavior, we rely on
stateless Data Tasks –without negative impact on usage as data-
base computations are evaluated independently–. The stateless
nature is an extension of the Data Task confinement by prevent-
ing access to the PDMS database managed by the Core or to the
secure storage. A stateless Data task is instantiated for the sole
purpose of answering a specific function call, after which it must
be terminated and its RAM wiped (destroying the Data Task’s
enclave on SGX).
P8. Deterministic Data Tasks. Without being able to maintain
state, a malicious Data Task could still exploit randomness as
the next best thing to increase overall leakage over multiple
executions. For example, at each execution, the Data Task selects
a random fragment of the input to produce a new leak with high
probability –even if the same computation is run on the same
input–. A final security element is thus to impose deterministic
Data Tasks, i.e., producing the same result for the same function
code run on the same input. The in-enclave sandbox [10, 17] can
be leveraged to provide this property by preventing access to any
source of randomness, e.g., syscalls to random APIs or timer/date.
Virtual random APIs are provided to preserve legitimate uses,
e.g., the need for sampling, and are ”reproducible“, e.g., random
numbers use a seed based on the function code and input set.

2.4 ES-PDMS Prototype Implementation
The demo platform runs on a server with Intel Xeon E-2276G 6-
core CPUs with 12 MB cache and SGX 1-FLC support, 64GB RAM.
The machine runs Ubuntu Linux 18.04 with SGX DCAP 1.41. The
code of the Core and Data Tasks are written using Open Enclave
(OE) [7], an SDK for developing enclave applications in C/C++.
OE provides support for Intel SGX as well as preview support
for ARM TrustZone, thus aiming to generalize the development
of enclave applications across TEEs. The Core communication
module uses the mbed TLS plugin integrated in OE to establish
secure channels with the Data Task enclaves, remote parties or
Apps. The Core data management module is based on SQLite
(v3). The end-to-end attestation (P5) relies on the Intel SGX re-
mote attestation with TLS[11] allowing to insert an attestation

etc.) and the use of SGX attestation enabling the Core to attest
at run time the compliance of the final result with the execution
manifest.

Part 2: demonstrating data leak containment with inter-
active games. Three concrete attack scenarios are proposed to
the attendees in the form of games. A first attack is conducted
by a PDMS user –an employee– in the Green bonus case. He
falsifies his GPS data to get the maximum number of bike trips
hoping to increase the financial benefit obtained. Attendees run
the attack on PDMS instances compiled with different properties
enabled/disabled and guess the impact on final results.

Then, we consider two attacks conducted by PDMS queriers
–who are employers in the Green bonus scenario–, wishing to gain
access to raw personal data of the PDMS user, using a legitimate
granted execute privilege on manifests leveraging potentially
corrupted Data Tasks –the code being potentially produced by
the querier–. We first consider a corrupted compute Task used
by the attacker to leak small size sensitive information (such as
a password), to demonstrate the importance of Limiting result
sizeo (P6), and making Data Task Stateless (P7) and Deterministic
(P8). Then, we concentrate on more advanced Data tasks used
in the Green bonus scenario, where attendees running different
instances of PDMS have to guess which properties –among which
P7 and P8– were enabled/disabled for each instance, based on
the results.

A final challenge for the attendees is to indicate the maxi-
mum number of executions needed to reveal a given amount of
points of interests in the PDMS user’s GPS history, by optimally
exploiting such attacks.

3 DEMONSTRATION SCENARIO
The scenario consists of two interactive parts 2 focusing on the
execution workflow and mitigation of data leakage. In a first
part, the attendee can run typical scenarios on PDMS instances
to understand its behavior and can visualize execution traces
highlighting the effect of properties P1 to P5 (see Section 2.2). The
second part focuses on properties P4 to P8 (see Section 2.3) and
is organized as an interactive game with the attendees through a
website.

Part 1: visualizing ES-PDMS secure workflow with con-
crete scenarios. A set of PDMS scenarios are proposed to the
attendee to process data from various external sources, including
Green bonus and other scenarios exploiting e-health data pro-
duced by a smartphone App and collected from the French public
social security service ’Ameli’. The attendee selects a scenario
by validating the corresponding manifest and launches the un-
derlying execution flow. The Core and Data Task enclaves are
configured to produce detailed sets of traces related to architec-
tural properties. The interface dynamically displays these traces
in three consoles (for the Core, the Data Task, and the App or
external data provider) and graphically highlights the modules
and database access in each component (Figure 3, upper part). For
Green bonus, the secure execution flow is split in two main stages:
data collection and data computation. Our PDMS demonstration
instruments these two steps.

Regarding data collection, after an initialization stage of the
enclaved Core/Data Tasks (P1) and the establishment of secure com-
munications (P2), we focus on traces related to Core as proxy (P3)
and Access control (P4), allowing to manage the user’s credentials
at the Core level and preventing externalization of unauthorized
personal to the third party. The data collected is stored in PDMS
tables with appropriate permissions for further use (including
by the compute tasks specified in the manifests). During the
Compute step, attention is drawn to the traces related to Access
Control (P4) and Attestations (P5). The interface shows both the
secure workflow applied on the inputs (e.g., provenance, integrity,
