Abstract
Text representations are widely used in NLP tasks such as text classification. Very powerful models have emerged and been
trained on huge corpora for different languages. However, most of the pre-trained models are domain-agnostic and fail
on domain-specific data. We perform a comparison of different text representations applied to French Real Estate classified
advertisements through several text classification tasks to retrieve some key attributes of a property. Our results demonstrate
the limitations of pre-trained models on domain-specific data and small corpora, but also the strength of text representation,
in general, to capture underlying knowledge about language and stylistic specificities.

1. Introduction

Real-estate classified advertisements provide great de-
tails and relevant information about a property that is
valuable for the intelligence of the real-estate market. For
example, price predictions are often based on attributes
such as the type of property, the number of rooms or
even the floor at which it is located. However, those key
information are not always clearly specified in the ads
and often differ from an ad to another and from an ad-
vertiser from another. Thus, the automatic extraction
of key information from the text of real-estate classified
advertisements is a challenging and promising task to
help in some real-estate market applications.

Given the limited number of different values that
economically relevant attributes of a real-estate prop-
erty may take, this information extraction task can be
viewed as a classification problem. For instance, if the
number of rooms of a property is sought for, the prob-
lem can be stated as assigning the property described
by a given advertisement to one of the classes labeled
as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5+}, corresponding to single-room, two-
room, three-room, four-room, and five-or-more-room
dwellings. Nevertheless, texts of real-estate ads are often
short with language and stylistic specificities and variabil-
ities. Also, an additional challenge may be represented by

the need to extract information from advertisements writ-
ten in languages other than English, for which linguistic
resources are thus harder to find or less well-developed.
Text representations models have emerged as very
powerful approaches to learn useful features of a text and
have been widely used for Machine Learning tasks such
as classification. It is thus interesting to carry out a com-
parative study of the most prominent models found in the
literature as they are applied to this specific text classifica-
tion task, to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
Our main contributions may be summarized as follows:

• we apply different text representations to a clas-
sification task to retrieve key attributes of prop-
erties found in classified advertisements written
in French, that we have collected and annotated
manually;

• we propose a comparison of the strength and
limitations of different text representations ;
• we analyse the vocabulary and register used by
French real-estate agents to understand their im-
pact in the classification.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
positions our contribution with respect to the literature;
Section 3 provides a detailed description of the dataset
and the method we propose to classify real-estate ads;
Section 4 reports the results of the experiment and draws
some conclusions.

2. Background and Related Work

From classical to the state-of-the-art methods, feature
extraction models are the process of converting raw data

55

One of the most common classical models is Bag-of-
words (BoW), which represents a text by the occurrence
of words. This model involves a vocabulary and a mea-
sure of the occurrence of words. The vocabulary captures
all the words found in the corpus of texts and is fixed.
Regarding the measure, it can be binary (presence or not
of a word in the text) or weighted. For example, Term
Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is
a weighted BoW that scores each word of a text by its
frequency in the text (TF) and across the whole corpus
(IDF). This measure penalizes very frequent words and
highlights relevant one. The classical methods are easy to
compute and customize for any language and text speci-
ficities. However, this approach suffers from a curse of
dimensionality because of the size of the vocabulary and
the sparsity. Also, it does not capture the position and
meaning of a word in a text.

Those limitations led to a feature learning technique
in which words are mapped to a vector of 𝑁 dimensions,
with 𝑁 smaller than the size of the vocabulary. This ap-
proach is called Word Embedding. The most well-known
model is Word2Vec, developed by Mikolov et al. [1] and
based on neural networks. Two architectures have been
released: continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and Skip-
gram. Both methods train a word against its neighboring
words in the input corpus. The main difference is CBOW
uses neighbors to predict the target word, while Skip-
gram uses the target to predict its neighbors.

A variant of Word2Vec is Doc2vec [2], which creates
a numeric representation for the whole document. As
Word2Vec, two architectures have been built. The first
one is based on CBOW with an extra input which is
the ID of the document. This model is called Distributed
Memory version of Paragraph Vector (PV-DM). The other
one is inspired by Skip-gram and is called Distributed
Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vector (PV-DBOW).
Finally, there exist other models similar to Word2Vec,
such as Global Vectors (GloVe) [3] or FastText [4]. Glove
focuses on the global context instead of local one and
uses a word-word co-occurrence matrix computed from
the entire corpus. FastText is based on the CBOW archi-
tecture but using 𝑛-grams as input instead of full words.
𝑁 -grams help to prevent the Out-of-Vocabulary problem
that suffer Word2Vec, Glove or classical representations.
However, this method requires a huge storage memory.
All of the feature learning techniques presented above
have limitations such as the need for a huge corpus to
train and failure to capture contextual information.

Context-based models try to tackle those limitations.
Contextual embeddings help to distinguish a same word
with a different meaning according to the semantics and
grammar. The first contextual embeddings models are
mainly based on the (Bi-)LSTM architecture. For example,

Figure 1: CBOW and Skip-gram architectures [1]

Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) [5] is a two-
layer bidirectional language model using Bi-LSTM. This
means that the left and right contexts are taken into
account in the predictions. Also, it uses a character-level
representation of words. Nevertheless, those kinds of
modes do not improve performance significantly and are
computationally very expensive.

The last state-of-the-art context-based model uses a
Transformer architecture [6]. It has been proven that
Transformers are faster and more efficient than (Bi)-
LSTM (ELMo) or CNN (Word2Vec). For example, Bidi-
rectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT) [7] and its variants are one of those models. BERT
uses parallel attention layers instead of sequential recur-
rent neural networks as ELMo does. Also, it is trained
on a huge corpus with two specific tasks: masked lan-
guage model (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP).
For MLM, some tokens are masked and the model has
to predict them in a sentence. The other task (NSP) is
to try to predict, between two sentences, which one fol-
lows the other one. Models like BERT reach high perfor-
mance compared to the other embedding models. How-
ever, some limitations have arisen: the need for a huge
training set and a pre-trained model on general domain
limits their application to specific domains or tasks. Thus,
some specific domain models have been trained such as
BERTTweet for Twitter or SciBERT for the biological
domain.

The advantages and limitations of the different exist-
ing word embedding models for low-quality data are
discussed in a recent survey of word representation mod-
els [8].

All the methods described above have been widely
used and compared for different tasks and types of text.
However, a few of them are focused on small data and
French documents, as in our work.

Dynomant et al. [9] compare mainly Word2Vec (Skip-
gram, CBOW), FastText and Glove on a specific dataset
(health-related documents) written in French. They also

56

Figure 2: BERT architecture [7]

have to come to grips with the issue of the quality of
language. According to their evaluation, which is more
qualitative (similarity, word clustering, etc.) than quanti-
tative, they find Word2Vec with a Skip-gram architecture
to be the most promising model.

Another work [10], comparing Word2Vec to latent
semantic analysis (LSA), shows that LSA gives better
results for small training corpora, while Word2Vec works
best with medium-sized training corpora. This study
too carries out a qualitative, rather than quantitative,
analysis.

A recent survey of text classification algorithms [11]
illustrates essentially the same methodology we followed,
consisting of pre-processing, feature extraction, and clas-
sification, by covering a variety of models of text repre-
sentations (BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT, etc.) and clas-
sification (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests,
Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Deep Learn-
ing). It compares the advantages and limitations of each
model. Also, the authors mention several works in differ-
ent domains, including health, business, and social, and
their applications.

Finally, Gupta and Waseem [12] try different word
embedding models to detect hate speech from Twitter
and use Logistic Regression to classify tweets. The au-
thors find Word2Vec to perform better than Glove, and
FastText to be the worst model in that setting. They
also provide compelling evidence that, while domain-
specific models outperform domain-agnostic ones, their
combination yields the best results. In addition, they find
Doc2Vec to perform poorly and Tweet2Vec (specifically
designed for Twitter micro-blogs) to perform rather well
on imbalanced data, but less so on balanced data.

3. Method

In this section, we will first describe the dataset, then the
preprocessing and feature extraction applied on the ad-

vertisments and, finally, the different classification tasks
that we have used for the comparison.

3.1. Dataset
We gathered 5,440 real-estate classified advertisements of
residential and commercial properties, luxury homes and
garages/parkings, all located on the French Riviera, from
various French online advertisers. The ads are written in
French and composed of a title, description, pictures, and
some metadata about the property (e.g type of property,
number of rooms, price, etc.). Metadata include the most
important and relevant information to summarize a prop-
erty. However, metadata differ from an ad to another and
from an advertiser to another. On the other hand, all ads
contain a textual description which is a great source of
information to infer missing metadata.

In our study, we focused on extracting the type of
property, the number of rooms, and the apartment’s floor.
As we have this information in metadata for a sufficient
number of ads, it was relatively easy to label the texts and
to apply classification for each type of information. Also,
we created artificial classes to normalize our targets. For
example, for the type of property, we did not distinguish a
luxury villa from a small house : both have been classified
as ’House’. Regarding the number of rooms, it goes from
’1’ to ’5 and more’ rooms which is a popular discretization
in the Real Estate market. Finally, the floor of the property
is divided in 5 classes : from ’Ground floor’ to ’third floor’
and then, ’High floor’ and ’Last Floor’. The last two
classes might be confusing as ’Last Floor’ is also a ’High
Floor’ but the information ’Last Floor’ could be important
in price predictions.

Tables 1, 2, and 3 show the class distribution for each
target. The type of property is complete (0 missing data)
but not really balanced. It is very easy to get the type of
property in the metadata since it is essential to sell the
product. However, the number of rooms and the floor of
a property are not complete. This is the reason why it

might be interesting to predict this kind of information
from the text. Also, we only predict the number of rooms
for apartments and houses, and the floor of the property
only for apartments.

Although we plan on making our dataset publicly avail-
able, for the time being we could not, for legal reasons,
as it is expressly forbidden by the real-estate agencies
that own those advertisements to republish them in any
form, as long as the relevant properties are still on the
market.

3.2. Text Preprocessing
Preprocessing and cleaning texts are a crucial step since
French real-estate ads are full of noisy, repetitive words
and abbreviations.
First, we removed noise such as elongated punctuations
(“......”, “!!!!”, etc.) and URLs. We replaced symbols such as
“e” by “euros”, “m2”, “M2”, and “M2” by “m2”. Also, some
abbreviations are of common use in the real-estate mar-
ket, e.g., ‘apt.’ stands for apartment, ‘balc.’ for balcony.
We tried to remove proper nouns found in phrases such
as “contactez Paul Martin” (contact Paul Martin), which
refer to the advertiser, thanks to a regex.
Then, we lemmatized texts with a French lemmatizer
from spaCy. This lemmatizer has been trained on the
French Sequoia corpus1 and WikiNER. The lemmatizer
performs pretty well for French, as we can see in Figure 3.
Nevertheless, the syntax of real-estate ads is slightly dif-
ferent from the general French syntax and the lemmatizer
fails to assign the correct lemma. For example, the noun
“nuit” (night) in the phrase “coin nuit” (sleeping area) is
erroneously lemmatized in the verb “nuire” (nuit is also
the 3rd person sg. form of “nuire”, to harm).
The final step was to remove punctuation, numbers and
French stopwords. We tuned the stopword list with very
frequent words in the real estate vocabulary, e.g., “hon-
oraires” (fees), “agent immobilier” or “agent commercial”
(real-estate agent).

3.3. Feature Extraction
After cleaning the texts, we applied different text repre-
sentations methods presented in Section 2.

Two classical Bag-of-Words methods have been tested
: TF and TF-IDF. We set maximum features to 5,000 and
we chose to take a range of 𝑛-grams from 1 to 3, that is
to say from 1 to 3 tokens.

Then, we tried non-contextual embedding with
Word2Vec (Skip-Gram), Doc2Vec (PV-DM), and FastText.
We trained those 3 models on our corpus of ads. We
chose a smaller number of features for FastText because
of its need of memory storage. We wanted to compare
our own trained non-contextual embeddings with a pre-
trained model, but only few models have been trained
on a French corpora. Thus we only found a pre-trained
Word2Vec model [13].

Finally, we wanted to apply contextual embedding.
However, although pre-trained (Bi-)LSTM models such
as ELMo have recently become available for French,2 we
were not aware of them at the time we planned our ex-
periments. Now, it is very long to train a model and a
huge corpus is needed, which we lack. Therefore, we de-
cided to try pre-trained Transformer models for French,
like CamemBERT [14] and FlauBERT [15]. These French
models chiefly differ for their training data. CamemBERT
was trained on OSCAR [16], whose size is 138 GB after
cleaning, while FlauBERT used 24 corpora from different
sources (Wikipedia, books, Common Crawl, etc.), whose
overall size is only half as the CamemBERT training data
(71 GB). They also differ for their tokenizer: FlauBERT
uses a basic Byte Pair Encoding [17], whereas Camem-
BERT prefers its extension, called SentencePiece [18]. Fi-
nally, the models use different strategies for the masking
task: FlauBERT masks sub-word, whereas CamemBERT
masks the whole word.

3.4. Classification Task
The final step was to classify our real-estate ads accord-
ing to three labels (Type of property, Number of rooms

and Floor of the property) in order to retrieve missing
metadata. We used our different feature extractions as
input and we applied a classifier. Different classifiers
have been tried (e.g. Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression,
or Random Forest) for every text representations, but in
the following, we will only present results with Logistic
Regression as it gave higher score. CamemBERT and
FlauBERT have been already trained for classification, so
we used their classifier based on neural networks.

We also compared our models to a simple Regex, which
is our baseline. For instance, to find the type of property,
we crafted rules that classify a property as an apartment
if the words “apartment” or “studio” are found; else if
“house” or “villa” are found, it is classified as house, and so
on. For the number of rooms, we searched for a number
(in words or digits) before the word “pièce” (room) or
“chambre” (bedroom); if we find a number before “pièce”
then we take it as the label for classification; else, if we
find a number before “chambre”, we take that number
plus one. The same idea is followed for the floor of a
property, but the word “étage” (floor) is used instead.

We used the F1-Score as measure of accuracy to handle

imbalanced classes.

4. Experiments and Results

In this section, we will present the results of our ex-
periments and the comparison of the different text rep-
resentations. Afterward, we will discuss the possible
explanations of the results and infer knowledge for the
real-estate market.

4.1. Classification results and

Comparison

The results of the classification show that most of the
text representation methods combined with a classifier
outperform the Regex baseline. It shows that Real Estate
ads are too noisy to retrieve information easily. Nev-
ertheless, we noticed that the predictions of number of
rooms are slightly better with a regex for 2, 3 or 4 rooms.
The advertisers seem to write more often the number of
rooms for those classes than for ’1’ or ’5 and more’ rooms
in their description.

Comparing text representations, classical methods
(mainly TF-IDF) and CamemBERT achieved the best
F1-Score. Non-contextual methods such as Word2Vec,
Doc2Vec or FastText lagged behind. FlauBERT fared
even worse. FastText and FlauBERT are more based on a
character or sub-word level. However, the vocabulary of
French real-estate ads is pretty poor and might not be
suitable for this level. On the contrary, Doc2Vec embeds
the whole paragraph and is less precise. Most paragraphs
contain the same kind of vocabulary and syntax, so
Doc2Vec fails to discriminate them. In general, classical
methods gave better results, except for CamemBERT,
which has similar results. Nevertheless, the training
dataset was really small and the performance of more
complex methods might improve with a larger corpus.

4.2. Discussion
The comparison of the text representations for the classi-
fications tasks highlights that classical representations
such as TD-IDF have better results than non-contextual
word-embbedings (Word2vec, FastText, etc.) or quite

similar with state-of-the-art models (CamemBERT). This
result might be explained by the lack of data and a very
narrow vocabulary found in the ads.

Also, it could be surprising that text representations
combined with classification algorithms outperform sim-
ple regular expression. Thus, we analysed the odds ratio
of the Logistic Regression used for the classification com-
bined with TF-IDF representations since it gave good

results. Odds ratio helps to know if a variable (e.g., a
word) is increasing or decreasing the probability of the
text belonging to one class or another. In Tables 7, 8
and 9, we can see the words that increase or decrease
the most the probability for each class. For example, the
probability is obviously increased by the word that de-
scribes the class, such as “apartment”, “house”, for the
type of product, or “two rooms”, “three rooms” for the

number of rooms. However, it is interesting to see that
unexpected words turn out to have an important impact.
Indeed, we can see that real-estate agents target different
people according to the number of rooms. They often use
words about investment for one- or two-room dwellings,
while they target parents with children for three-room
properties. Furthermore, the vocabulary used to clas-
sify the floor of the property is also different. An agent
will describe more the view for a high floor than for the
ground floor. For instance, the expression “panoramic
view” is associated to “Last Floor”.

In a nutshell, this study points out the specific and
stylistic vocabulary used by French real-estate agents. As
we have shown, basic information is not always clearly
and explicitly written in the ads. However, other words
can help to infer such key information for the real-estate
market.

5. Conclusion and Further Work

In this paper, we carried out a comparison of various text
representations models with respect to their application
to the classification of real-estate classified advertise-
ments in French, having the ultimate goal of extracting
key information about the properties they advertise.

In summary, we found out that, among the models we
tested, the classic representation TF-IDF and the most
state-of-the-art model CamemBERT are the ones that

stand out for the classification task.

Another interesting finding is that pre-trained models,
despite having been trained on a much larger corpus and
with impressive computational resources, turn out not
to be much useful, due to their being domain-agnostic,
whereas models trained on our small domain-specific
corpus clearly outperform them, thus confirming similar
findings in other domains [12].

Finally, we provided knowledge about the vocabulary
and the type of register use by the real-estate agents
according to the property they advertise.

We believe that our results will provide useful guidance
to anybody willing to engage in real-estate classified ads
classification, in general, and information extraction in
particular.

A promising research direction which is, in our opin-
ion, worth investigating is to combine different text rep-
resentations models, each capable of capturing different
details, in order to obtain a higher overall accuracy. An-
other quite obvious extension of our investigation would
be to gather a bigger corpus of advertisements and study
how using it to train the model increases the classification
accuracy. Large language models could also be consid-
ered, as a possible end-to-end solution to this information
extraction task.

As future work, it could be interesting to capture the
syntax of real-estate ads in order to understand even
better their language. Also, property pictures, which of-
