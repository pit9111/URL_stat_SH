ABSTRACT

To strengthen public trust and counter disinformation, computa-
tional fact-checking, leveraging digital data sources, attracts interest
from the journalists and the computer science community. A partic-
ular class of interesting data sources is statistics, that is, numerical
data compiled mostly by governments, administrations, and inter-
national organizations. Statistics typically are multidimensional
datasets, where multiple dimensions characterize one value, and
the dimensions may be organized in a hierarchy.

We developed StatCheck, a fact-checking system specialized
in French. The technical novelty of StatCheck is twofold: (𝑖) we
focus on multidimensional, complex-structure statistics, which have
received little attention so far, despite their practical importance;
and (𝑖𝑖) novel statistical claim extraction modules for French, an
area where few resources exist. We will demonstrate our system on
large statistic datasets (hundreds of millions of facts), including the
complete INSEE (French) and Eurostat (European Union) datasets.

A video demonstration of our system is available online1.

1 INTRODUCTION
Professional journalism work has always involved verifying in-
formation with the help of trusted sources. In recent years, the
proliferation of media in which public figures make statements, in
particular online, has lead to an explosion in the amount of content
that may need to be verified to distinguish accurate from inaccurate,
and even potentially dangerous, information.

To help journalists deal with the deluge of information, com-
putational fact-checking [CLL+18, NCH+21] emerges as a grow-
ing, multidisciplinary field. The main tasks of a fact-checking sys-
tem are: identifying the claims made in an input document, find-
ing the relevant evidence from a reference corpus, and (option-
ally) producing an automated verdict (is the claim true or false?).
A reference corpus can be a knowledge graph [CSR+15], Web
sources such as Wikipedia [NCB19, YMW+18], or relational ta-
bles [CWC+20, HNM+20, JTY+19, KSPT20].

For fact-checks to be convincing, professional journalists prefer
reference sources of high quality, carefully built by specialists. These
include statistics produced by governmental and international or-
ganizations, such as INSEE (the French national statistics institute)
and Eurostat (the equivalent EU office). Technically speaking, such
statistics are multidimensional tables, where a fact is a number,
characterized by one or more a dimensions, such as a geographical

unit, time interval, and other categories such as “Education level”.
Such data sources are significantly more complex than relational
tables, making their usage challenging. Consequently, despite the
interest in such sources, few works have used them for automatic
fact-checking [CMT18, DCMT19].

We propose to demonstrate StatCheck, a fact-checking system
specialized in the French media. We developed StatCheck in a
collaboration between computer science researchers and journalists
at Radio France, the French national radio, with a daily audience
recently estimated at 15.8M users2. StatCheck builds upon the
open-source code base of [CMT18, DCMT19], which it generalizes
into a first generic fact-checking pipeline based on multidi-
mensional statistics. Different from [CWC+20, HNM+20, JTY+19,
KSPT20, CSR+15, NCB19, YMW+18], StatCheck also includes a
claim detection step, which saves journalists’ time by focusing
their attention on the claims worth checking; our claim detection
module significantly outperforms the only one we know of for
French [DCMT19]. The fact-checking journalist authors prefer to
interpret the relationship between the known statistics and the
statistic claim StatCheck identifies and include these interpreta-
tions in various news segments they author.
Outline Below, we present the actual organization of statistic
databases, and the StatCheck architecture, in Section 2. Then,
we explain how this architecture is instantiated over two different
sources, INSEE and Eurostat, whose size and organization signif-
icantly varies, in Section 3; we ingest and index all the data to
support efficient search over it, as described in Section 4. We find
claim by subscribing to media sources, or allowing users to up-
load their own content (Section 5). We then describe the proposed
demonstration scenarios (Section 6).
2 FACT-CHECKING BASED ON

MULTIDIMENSIONAL STATISTICS

A multidimensional dataset consists of a set of facts, each having
one value along a set of dimensions. For instance, Figure 1 (top)
represents three-dimensional datasets: French departments are on
the horizontal axis, education levels on the vertical axis, while years
are on the third (depth) axis. In each cell, the dataset could store
the number of students in the respective department, level of study,
and year. However, the actual Open Data statistics published by
the government or international organizations are typically much
more complex, as shown at the bottom of Figure 1. First, to save
space, dimension values may be encoded into short codes, e.g., “HI”
for “High school”, “MI” for “Middle school”; a decoding dictionary,
associating a human-understandable term to each code, is published

that Paris and Essonne are departments in the Île-de-France region.
Further, statistic claims may use similar but different language, e.g.,
a claim may be made about “pupils in Île-de-France”. Linguistic
knowledge must be leveraged to connect the claim terminology
with that of the dataset. Fine-granularity answers are preferred
that is: if the answer consists of one or a few cells only, those should
be returned to avoid users’ efforts to search through facts in a file
(a dataset can have millions of lines). Finally, speed at scale is
essential to enable journalists to work efficiently.

To address these challenges, we have devised an architecture
shown in Figure 2. The modules in the lower row acquire reference
datasets and analyze and index them. Those in the upper row ac-
quire content to be fact-checked, extract claims, and identify,the
most pertinent stored facts to use to check the claims.
3 STATISTIC FACT DATABASE
We crawled the INSEE [www22b] and Eurostat [www22a] Web
sites, extracting and storing their complete statistics as follows.

INSEE publishes each statistic report as an HTML page con-
taining a description (title and comments) and statistic tables, in
Excel or HTML. As of May 2022, there are 60,002 Excel files (each
of which may contain several tables) and 58,849 HTML tables. The
table organization varies significantly across the datasets; nested
headers are frequent. The largest table has 50.885 lines. Follow-
ing [CMT17], to capture all the elements of an INSEE dataset, we
turn it into an RDF graph, where each data cell, header cell, and
partial aggregate becomes an RDF node (URI). Further, each data
cell or partial aggregate node is connected, through an RDF triple,
to the cells corresponding to its closest header cells. Thus, the num-
ber of elementary school students in Paris in 2019 is connected
to header cells labeled “Paris”, respectively, “Elementary school
2019” - observe that we decoded “EL 2019” using the dictionary.
Further, each header cell is connected through an RDF triple to
its parent header cell. This allows us to quickly find out that the
elementary school students in Paris in 2019 are also counted as
being in the Île-de-France region. Finally, we create an RDF node
per dataset, connected to all its header cells and the textual title
and comments (each modeled as an RDF literal). The INSEE corpus
lead to 7,362,538,629 RDF triples, including 22,366,376 header
cells. We store them in Apache’s Fuseki (with TDB2) RDF store.

Eurostat publishes 6,803 statistic tables, ranging from 2 lines to
37 million lines, and 580 dictionaries that, together, decode 243,083
statistical concepts codes into natural-language descriptions. To-
gether, the data files total 414.908.786 lines. In Eurostat, dimension
hierarchies are described in the dictionaries; we store them in mem-
ory. The statistic tables are simple TSV files; we keep them in this
format, complemented by specialized indexes, as we explain below.
4 STATISTIC SEARCH
Given a keyword query 𝑄 = {𝑘1, 𝑘2, . . . , 𝑘𝑛 }, such as “middle school
pupils in Île-de-France in 2020”, we find: the most relevant facts
from our INSEE and Eurostat corpus; or, if a specific fact is not
found, but some datasets appear related to the query, return those
datasets. In general, there may be both fact-level and dataset-level
answers; we return a ranked list based on their relevance.

We call metadata of a statistic dataset all the natural-language
elements part of or associated with the dataset: its title, comments,
and human-understandable versions of all its header values. We

with, or close to the data cells. Although not shown in the figure,
dimension names are similarly encoded. Second, header cells, shown
in yellow and green in the figure, may be mixed with data cells;
this requires effort to interpret them correctly. Note also that there
can be a hierarchy of headers, e.g., a dataset at the granularity of
departments may also include region names, e.g., “Île-de-France”
and “Grand Est”, placed in the data files above, or close to, the region
header cells. Third, datasets may contain partially aggregated results
next to the cell-level data, illustrated by the orange box holding
the sum of all facts for one region (Grand Est), one education level
(elementary), and the three years. Fourth, for each dataset, there
may exist a separate, textual description, which contains a title, e.g.,
“French student population”, and other comments.
Data representation in files. In practice, a multidimensional
statistic dataset is published as a file, which can be CSV, a spread-
sheet, etc. The dataset is laid out in a bidimensional format, with
facts on each line and as many lines as needed. If the data has more
than two dimensions, which is often the case, this leads to row
header cells encoding several dimensions and their values, such as
“HI 2019”, “MI 2019” etc., in the figure. The file may start with the
column headers (yellow), then the encoded multidimensional row
header cell “EL 2019” followed by the four cells corresponding to it,
then a similar line for “MI 2019”, a line for “HI 2019”, followed by
similar lines for 2020, then 2021, etc. Partially aggregated results
are interspersed between such lines.
Challenges and architecture. To exploit such datasets for fact-
checking, a set of challenges must be addressed. The useful in-
formation, e.g., “How many elementary school students were in
the Île-de-France region in 2019?”, is a number in a cell. To find
such information, we must identify and store its relationships
with human-understandable descriptions of its dimensions,
such as “Education level: Elementary school”. In this example, the
question is asked at a granularity (region) more coarse than the
granularity of the data. To find the answer, we must exploit the fact

use L = {𝑇 , 𝐻, 𝐶} to denote the set of the locations in which
a term can appear in metadata, respectively: the dataset title, a
header, or a comment. The locations are important: (𝑖) since a term
appearing in a title is more important than one appearing in a
header (Section 4.1); (𝑖𝑖) to determine if a dataset matches some
keywords headers of different dimensions - in which case the cell
at the intersection of those dimensions likely has a very pertinent
result (Section 4.2).

4.1 Dataset Indexing and Search
We split the metadata of each dataset 𝑑 into a set of tokens 𝑇 =
{𝑡1, . . . , 𝑡𝐷 }. For each token 𝑡, we identify, based on a Word2Vec
model, the 50 tokens 𝑡 ′ closest semantically to 𝑡.

Next, for each appearance of a token 𝑡 in location 𝑙 within an
INSEE dataset 𝑑, our term-location index 𝐼𝑇 𝐿 stores: an entry
of the form (𝑡, 𝑑, 𝑙), and 50 entries of the form (𝑡 ′, 𝑑, 𝑙, 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡), for the
50 tokens closest to 𝑡. For instance, when 𝑡 is "school", 𝑡 ′ could be
"teacher", "pupil", "student", etc. For fast access, 𝐼𝑇 𝐿 is stored in the
Redis in-memory key-value store.

The large size of Eurostat statistics prevents cell- or row-level
metadata indexing, as the index might outgrow the memory. So
instead, we index occurrences of statistical concept codes in datasets,
as follows. Let 𝑐 be a Eurostat concept, e.g., "EL", appearing in
dataset 𝑑 at a location 𝑙 ∈ L, and 𝑑𝑐 be the decoding of 𝑐, e.g.,
"Elementary school" for "EL". Let 𝑇𝑑𝑐 = {𝑡1, 𝑡2, . . . , 𝑡𝑁 } be the tokens
in 𝑑𝑐 , and for 1≤𝑖≤𝑁 , let 𝑡 𝑗
𝑖 , for 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 50, be the tokens closest to
𝑡𝑖 . For each 𝑡𝑖 ∈ 𝑇𝑑𝑐 , we insert in the term-dataset index 𝐼𝑇 , also
stored in Redis: a (𝑡𝑖, 𝑑, 𝑙) entry; and, for every 𝑡 𝑗
𝑖 similar to 𝑡𝑖 , an
𝑖 , 𝑑, 𝑙, 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡, 𝑡𝑖 ), where 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡 is the distance between 𝑡𝑖 and 𝑡 𝑗
entry (𝑡 𝑗
𝑖 .
Given the query 𝑄 = {𝑘1, . . . , 𝑘𝑛 }, we search 𝐼𝐶𝐿 and 𝐼𝑇 for en-
tries of the form (𝑘𝑖, 𝑑, 𝑙) or (𝑘𝑖, 𝑑, 𝑙, 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡, 𝑘′
𝑖 ) for each 𝑘𝑖 . We rank
datasets based on the relevance score introduced in [CMT18]. It
leverages the word distances between the query keywords and the
datasets’ metadata and also reflects the locations where the key-
words were found for each dataset. Among the retrieved datasets,
we keep the 20 having the highest score.

4.2 Data Cell Indexing and Search

Our next task is to extract results at the finest granularity level
possible. Let 𝑑 be one of the most interesting datasets, and 𝐼 (𝑑)
be the set of all index entries for the query 𝑄 and 𝑑. For our
sample query 𝑄 and dataset in Figure 1, 𝐼 (𝑑) contains:

• For "middle school", header (𝐻 ) entries for "Middle school"
(exact), as well as for "High school" and "Elementary school"

(similar); a title (𝑇 ) entry for "student" (similar); and a com-
ment (𝐶) entry for "school" (similar);

• For "pupils", 𝐻 , 𝑇 , and 𝐶 entries for the similar words above;
• For "Île-de-France", an exact 𝐻 entry, and two similar 𝐻

entries for "Paris" and "Essonne";

• For "2020", exact 𝐻 entries.

If 𝐼 (𝑑) only features title (𝑇 ) or comment (𝐶) locations, then 𝑑 is

pertinent as a whole, and no cell search is needed.

On the contrary, if 𝐼 (𝑑) has several header entries (having 𝑙 = 𝐻 ),
matching two or more distinct query keywords (or close terms), this
means that 𝑑 holds some fine-granularity results for the query. If
𝐼 (𝑑) holds an entry along each dataset dimension 𝑑, they designate
exactly one cell, and we can directly return its value. Otherwise,
the result is a collection of all the cells from 𝑑 characterized by the
dimension values designated by the entries in 𝐼 (𝑑). In our example,
we should return the cells for "MI 2019", "2020", and locations "Paris"
and "Essonne", which belong to Île-de-France.

• If 𝑑 is an INSEE dataset, 𝐼 (𝑑) specifies exactly which rows
and columns are concerned. Then, the cell is identified by
asking a SPARQL query [CMT18], evaluated by Fuseki.
• On the contrary, if 𝑑 is an Eurostat dataset, 𝐼 (𝑑) only specifies
that "some row (column) headers match". Identifying the
relevant cells requires more effort, as we explain below.
An Eurostat file has at most a few dozen columns. To find the
column referred to by an 𝐼 (𝑑) entry whose key is 𝑘, we search for
𝑘 in the first (header) line of 𝑑. To efficiently find the row even
in a huge file, we created another index on all the Eurostat data
files, inspired by the Adaptive Positional Map of [ABB+15], storing
the positions of the data rows in 𝑑 containing 𝑘 in their header.
Knowing the rows and column indexes, we read the relevant row(s)
from 𝑑, and extract from them the relevant data cell(s). On both
INSEE and Eurostat, this takes from a few microseconds to 2.5s.
5 CLAIM DETECTION
A claim is a statement to be validated. The validation is achieved
by finding related statements, called evidence, which back up or
disprove the claim. In our work, the claims are detected in an input
text, while the evidence is retrieved from a set of trusted sources,
our reference datasets.
5.1 Statistical Claim Detection

In [DCMT19], the authors introduced a statistical claim detection
method that given an input set of statistical entities (e.g. chômage,
coefficient budgétaire) and a sentence, it retrieves all the statistical
statements of the form ⟨statistical entity, numerical value and

unit, date⟩ present in the sentence. The statistical statement, if
present, represents the statistical claim to be verified. The statistical
entities and units are retrieved using exact string matching, while
the date is extracted using HeidelTime [SG10], a time expression
parser. If the parser finds no date, the posting timestamp is used.
The initial statistical entity list is constructed from the reference
datasets by taking groups of tokens from the headers of tables, we
refer to [DCMT19] for more details.

We improved the method presented in [DCMT19] to optimize
both the speed and quality of extractions. We refer to the two
methods as OriginalStatClaim [DCMT19] and StatClaim. We first
performed a more careful match between the tokens of a sentence
and our input statistical entities. Then, using the syntactic tree of
the sentence and a lemmatizer, statistical entities are matched using
their lemma, and are extended to contain the entire nominal group
of the matched token. Numerical values are associated with units
using both lemmas matching from our set of units and syntactic
analysis. As in the original approach, if we retrieve a statistical
statement of the form ⟨statistical entity, numerical value, and
unit, date⟩, we have found a claim to verify. In the default setting
of our algorithm, a claim should contain all three elements.

5.2 Check-worthy Claim Detection

To complement the statistical claim detection model, we developed
a model that is not conditioned on a set of initial statistical entities.
Instead, the model classifies a sentence as check-worthy or not,
where check-worthiness is defined as sentences containing factual
claims that the general public will be interested in learning about
their veracity [AHLT20]. We leveraged the ClaimBuster dataset
[AHLT20], containing check-worthy claims in English from the
U.S. Presidential debates, to train a cross-lingual language model,
XLM-R [CKG+19], which can perform zero-shot classification on
French sentences after having been trained on English data.
The ClaimBuster dataset. ClaimBuster is a crowd-sourced dataset
of 11𝐾 sentences from the 15 U.S. presidential elections debates from
1960 to 2016 that have been annotated. Each sentence is labeled as
check-worthy or not; we use them to fine-tune the XLM-R model.
Classification. The XLM-R model is a Transformer-based language
model which achieves state-of-the-art results on multilingual tasks

such as the XNLI benchmark [CRL+18], while remaining competi-
tive on monolingual tasks. We used a weighted cross-entropy loss
to account for the unbalanced ratio of labels. The dataset was split
into train, dev, and test datasets with a ratio of 80%/%10%/10%. We
fine-tune the model using a learning rate of 5 · 10−5, a batch size of
64, and the AdamW optimizer.
Evaluation. To evaluate the performance of the different mod-
els on French data, we randomly sampled 200 French tweets and
labeled them as check-worthy or not following the definition in
[AHLT20]. The Cohen Kappa score for inter-annotator agreement
is 0.6, signifying moderate to substantial agreement. The results
can be found in Table 1. The drop in precision on French data could
be because we are evaluating on a small test dataset or because the
tweets’ format and vocabulary might differ from the ones in the
training dataset.
6 DEMONSTRATION SCENARIOS
Our system is developed in Python and deployed on a Unix server.
Its GUI is accessible via a Web server; Figure 3 illustrates it.

Demonstration attendees will be able to: (𝑖) Ask queries in the
statistic search interface, and inspect the results, at the level of
cell, line, or column, together with their metadata from the original
statistic site (INSEE or Eurostat); (𝑖𝑖) Visualize the analysis of in-
coming social media messages (as they arrive in real-time), in order
to see the statistical mentions and claims deemed potentially check-
worthy, identified in these messages; StatCheck also proposes
candidate queries for the statistic search interface, as shown in
Figure 3. (𝑖𝑖𝑖) Select various options (restrict to numerical claims or
not, include statements about the future or not, include first-person
texts or not, etc.) and see their impact on the claim extraction out-
put. (𝑖𝑣) Write their own text and/or suggest other content to be
processed by our analysis pipeline (Section 5).

For the non-French speaking audience, we will use Google Trans-
late for social media messages, and prepare examples where French
and English statistic terms are sufficiently close, e.g., industrie, etc.
