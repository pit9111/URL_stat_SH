ABSTRACT
Data trees, typically encoded in JSON, are ubiquitous in data-driven
applications. This ubiquity makes urgent the development of novel
techniques for querying heterogeneous JSON data in a flexible
manner. We propose a rule language for JSON, called constrained
tree-rules, whose purpose is to provide a high-level unified view
of heterogeneous JSON data and infer implicit information. As rea-
soning with constrained tree-rules is undecidable, we identify a
relevant subset featuring tractable query answering, for which we
design an automata-based query rewriting algorithm. Our approach
consists of leveraging NoSQL document stores by means of a novel
instance-aware query-rewriting technique. We present an exten-
sive experimental analysis on large collections of several million
JSON records. Our results show the importance of instance-aware
rewriting as well as the efficiency and scalability of our approach.

1 INTRODUCTION
Rule-based languages have been studied by the database commu-
nity for more than four decades because of their importance in
processing enterprise data and knowledge [8]. In the recent years,
companies like LogicBlox and Relational-AI commercialized full-
fledged solutions for rule-based data processing and explainable
AI [13, 20]. At the same time, companies like Linkedin, Google,
Facebook, and Samsung, among others, developed their own rule
engines for reasoning on data [43, 66, 80]. The interest in such
formalisms comes from declarativity and expressivity, which make
rules a universal form of knowledge suitable for many tasks such as
data-integration [46], recursive queries [8], ontologies and seman-
tic constraints [35], data quality and data preparation for feeding
machine learning and analytic tools [20, 51].

The variety of data that can be handled by rule languages led
to the design of solutions for reasoning on knowledge graphs and
hypergraphs [20, 41, 68]. Nevertheless, in many practical cases,
data exhibits a simpler structure. There is a sheer amount of semi-
structured data held by transactional systems, data warehouses,
and data lakes, which takes the form of data trees. Today, this data is
typically serialized as JSON. Beside this, data trees also permeate the
whole Web, where JSON is exchanged at a massive rate. As a bottom
line, JSON trees are ubiquitous in data-oriented applications, hence
among the most practically relevant formats today. This ubiquity
makes urgent the development of novel techniques for querying
heterogeneous JSON data in a flexible manner.

Towards this aim, we study a rule language for JSON suitable to:
(1) act as a mediating level to integrate heterogeneous JSON data; (2)
allow one to enrich the querying vocabulary, hence to adapt it to spe-
cific use-cases and free the end-users from mastering the complexity
and irregularity of data; (3) be equipped with reasoning capabilities,
i.e., be able to infer information not explicitly stored in the data
thereby bringing novel and pertinent answers to the user queries.
In the quest for such language, a crucial requirement is that it must
enable efficient and scalable query answering techniques. Our new
approach is to use NoSQL document stores for query-answering
over data-trees together with instance-aware query-rewriting tech-
niques to build a scalable and efficient end-to-end framework
for reasoning on JSON databases.

Example 1.1. Figure 1 shows three JSON trees (pictured in black
solid lines) 𝑇1, 𝑇2, 𝑇3 holding GitHub data from the public archive
[2]. This collection built for data analysis contains 17 types of events
stemming from user actions. Data is complex and irregular. For a
data-scientist willing to exploit the archive, tasks like 𝑖) running
short explorative queries or 𝑖𝑖) extracting a training-set for machine
learning algorithms can both be extremely time consuming, because
of the time required to formulate the “right” queries to the data. To
illustrate, a simple information such as the name (login) of a user
can appear within different JSON keys (e.g., author for commits,
actor for push, user for issues, and more) and within more than 60
different paths in the trees (e.g., actor.login, payload.commits,
payload.issue, etc). Let us consider the query 𝑞, which concerns
the activity of Linus Torvalds (torvalds). It retrieves the id of the
events where the user participated, through the answer variable
x. This query is empty on all trees, as it has no matches. Indeed, to
query the collection, one must first learn the irregular JSON structure.
In contrast, rules 𝑟1 − 𝑟6 can be added (on benefit of all end-users)
on top of data thereby providing a unified high-level vision of
the JSON records. Rules 𝑟4 − 𝑟6 introduce the high-level notion of
event from specific types of events (push, commit, issues), which

Rewriting consists at propagating the rules into the query thereby
leaving the data untouched. The aim is to produce a set of queries
whose evaluation on the data yields the same answers as the evalua-
tion of the input query on the extended database. Figure 2 illustrates
the rewriting of query 𝑞 from Example 1.1. In spirit, the rewriting
process replaces parts of a query matching a rule head with the rule
body itself. The advantages of query rewriting are multiple. First, it
requires no additional space to store inferences. Second, it is insen-
sitive to data updates. Third, it allows one to reason with read-only
access rights on the database. The most important however is that
rewriting can be deployed on top of existing database technology
[32, 37, 51, 64]. This has two main advantages: it makes the tech-
nique resilient to main-memory limitations, as data is stored on disk
and inferences not stored at all, and it allows one to delegate query
evaluation to the DBMS. On this matter, JSON has been adopted
as a data model by several NoSQL document stores, often praised
for their performances (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB, ArangoDB, to
cite a few). This opens up for the opportunity of building a novel
family of reasoners relying on query rewriting and NoSQL database
technology. Indeed, these systems come with adapted data layouts,
indexes, query algorithms, buffering, scheduling, and concurrent
data access mechanisms among others. All these components can
work together to make reasoning on JSON both efficient and scal-
able. Note that aiming at materialization on top of document stores
would almost inevitably lead to data blowups and no scalability
because of the tree data-model of JSON [67]. For these systems,
query rewriting is the prominent way to go.

Contribution. Designing a rewriting-based reasoner on NoSQL
document stores has been very little investigated so far [23, 24, 67].
This task poses significant technical challenges, namely identifying
𝑖) adequate languages for the task, together with 𝑖𝑖) algorithms and
optimizations to make query answering efficient and scalable.

Concerning the first point, to start with, one needs a query and
rule language that is closed, i.e., it generates only rewritings that
can be handled by the underlying NoSQL system. This is subtle, as
NoSQL systems often ensure efficient access to data by reducing
the expressivity of queries to rooted path- or tree-shaped queries or
forbidding joins. Here, we shall present a language of constrained
tree queries and rules enjoying this property. Then, the rewriting
process must be finite, which can limit the use recursion in rules.
Rewriting recursive rules (e.g., Datalog [8]) is generally disregarded,
and the typical solution is to restrict the language to ensure that the
set of rewritings of any query is finite [34, 36, 38]. Here, we take
another approach and rather try to cope with infinite rewriting
sets, while encoding them finitely. Finally, query answering with
the target rule language must have tractable data complexity (i.e.,
polynomial complexity in the size of the data) which is the minimum
requirement for efficiency over large data [20].

Concerning the second point, to design algorithms and optimiza-
tions for efficient and scalable reasoning, we believe that query
rewriting process cannot be agnostic to the underlying database.
Therefore, our goal is to couple query rewriting with an innovative
instance-aware evaluation strategy. This leverages on a combination
of data-summaries, partitioning, and parallelization that allow us to
achieve efficiency by distributing the evaluation of rewritings where
the matching data is and at the same time achieving scalability on
very large collections of JSON data thanks to the NoSQL facilities.

Figure 1: Rule-based Querying of GitHub Data

is handy for queries. Rules 𝑟1 − 𝑟3 abstract on the structure of data
to define high-level notions of the same types of events, including
the id and the user involved. Altogether, the rules enable implicit
inferences (pictured as red dashed edges and nodes) which provide
answers to 𝑞 from 𝑇1 and 𝑇3 without requiring users to master the
whole variability of data. Note that, as pictured, these are tree rules.
The left-hand-side (the body) encodes a tree structure to match,
while the right-hand-side (the head) encodes the inferences. Nodes
shared between the body and the head are linked by dotted lines.
Nodes that belong to the head only (in red), called existential nodes,
extend the tree by introducing fresh nodes; they are necessary to
restructure data. Further, as we shall see later, rules can be recursive.

As already said, querying heterogeneous JSON trees in a flexible
manner is critical for many data processing and governance tasks.
These include scenarios where one-of operations are executed, e.g.,
the preparation and extraction of training-sets from heterogeneous
data [20, 51]. These include scenarios where consecutive queries are
run and users expect online answers, e.g., in goal-driven explorative
queries [8, 22, 78]. In both cases, the solution is to use reasoning
algorithms based on materialization and query-rewriting techniques
[8, 27]. These are different approaches complementing each other,
for both theoretical and practical concerns [11, 16, 34, 52]. First,
each can handle only certain rule fragments; this, regardless of
the applicative scenarios. Indeed, both suffer from non-termination
issues for languages such as Datalog± (a.k.a. existential rules or
Tuple-Generating-Dependencies) [16, 19, 34]. This matters here, as
tree rules like those of Example 1.1 are related to these formalisms.
Second, assuming termination, every method best fits certain ap-
plicative scenarios and hardware constraints.

Materialization consists at extending the database with the in-
ferences produced by rules, as illustrated by Figure 1. In-memory
materialization is regarded as the most effective approach. Systems
based on this approach exhibit extremely high-performances be-
cause of their reasoning-oriented algorithms and data-structures
[20, 41, 68]. Yet, in-memory materialization is tied to the capacity
at storing inferences (or even loading data) in memory. Concretely,
this may confine the use of the technique to powerful hardware
even for medium size datasets. Materialization can also be realized
with a DBMS backend but it can be much less performant [11, 21].

Paper Organization. We introduce our framework in Section
2 then give a high-level presentation of our query answering tech-
niques (Sections 3 and 4). Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to formal
developments on query rewriting algorithms. The experimental
analysis is presented in Section 7. Section 8 discusses related work.
Proofs and further details can be found in the technical report [69].

2 FRAMEWORK
We begin by presenting an abstract setting for reasoning on JSON.
We start by posing the notion of tree which will be used throughout
the paper. Then, we introduce a new language made of constrained
tree rules and queries and define their semantics.

Briefly, a JSON record is a set of key-value pairs, where a value is
recursively defined as a terminal value (constant or null), a sequence
of values, or a record. We see a record as a rooted labeled unordered
tree, in which edges are labeled by keys, leaves are labeled by con-
stant or null values, and all the internal nodes are unlabeled. Note
that a key-value pair (𝑘, 𝑣) where 𝑣 is a sequence is represented by
edges labeled by 𝑘 leading to the nodes that represent the elements
of 𝑣.1 Example 1.1 illustrates the tree vision of records.

Trees Let L and V be (infinite) sets of edge labels and (terminal)
node values, respectively. A tree is a tuple 𝑇 = (N, E, 𝑡, 𝜆E, 𝜆N)
where N is a node set and E ⊆ N 2 is a non-empty edge set such that
(N, E) is a directed tree with root 𝑡 ∈ N . Then, 𝜆E : E → L is a
(total) edge labeling function (for JSON keys) and 𝜆N : leaves(𝑇 ) →
V ∪ {𝜖} is a (total) leaf labeling function (for JSON terminal values),
where leaves(𝑇 ) ⊆ N is the set of leaves of the tree. We distinguish
between valued leaves, which are those labeled by a value in V, and
unvalued leaves labeled by 𝜖. The corresponding subsets are denoted
by leavesV (𝑇 ) and leaves𝜖 (𝑇 ), respectively. Note that all edges are
labeled, while only leaf nodes may be valued. Standard definitions
about trees are extended in the obvious way. In particular, a subtree
of a tree 𝑇 is a tree included in 𝑇 ; it is a roooted subtree of 𝑇 if it has
the same root as 𝑇 .

Processing trees A leaf assignment of a tree 𝑇 is a function
leaves𝜖 (𝑇 ) → V whose application is defined as 𝜈 (𝑇 ) =
𝜈 :
(N, E, 𝑡, 𝜆E, 𝜈 ⊎𝜆N). Next, given a function 𝑓 , a set 𝐴 = {𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑙 }
and a sequence b = (𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑘 ), we note 𝑓 (𝐴) = {𝑓 (𝑎1), . . . , 𝑓 (𝑎𝑙 )}
and 𝑓 (b) = (𝑓 (𝑏1), . . . , 𝑓 (𝑏𝑘 )). Let 𝑇1 and 𝑇2 be trees with 𝑇𝑖 =

1We do not represent the ordering on the elements of a sequence, since the considered
queries do not exploit this order. Moreover, a nested sequence is seen as a constant.

(N𝑖, E𝑖, 𝑡𝑖, 𝜆E𝑖, 𝜆N𝑖 ). A homomorphism from 𝑇1 to 𝑇2 is a total func-
tion ℎ : N1 → N2 such that: (i) for all 𝑒 ∈ E1, ℎ(𝑒) ∈ E2 and
𝜆E 1 (𝑒) = 𝜆E 2 (ℎ(𝑒)); and (ii) for all 𝑛 ∈ leavesV (𝑇1), 𝜆N 1 (𝑛) =
𝜆N 2 (ℎ(𝑛)). A homomorphism ℎ is rooted if ℎ(𝑡1) = 𝑡2. A homomor-
phism ℎ from 𝑇1 to 𝑇2 is an isomorphism if ℎ−1 is also a homomor-
phism (from 𝑇2 to 𝑇1).

Instances and rules An instance is simply a tree (like 𝑇1,𝑇2,𝑇3
in Figure 1). To distinguish, we will call collection a set of trees. In
pictures, edges are always considered as oriented from the root
(black node) to the leaves. The body and the head of a rule are
both trees, which share their root and some leaves; moreover,
leaves in the body may be constrained, which means that they
must be mapped to valued nodes in the data. Formally, a con-
strained tree-rule (or simply rule) is a triple 𝑟 = (B, H, C) where B
and H are trees representing the body and head of 𝑟 , also denoted
by Body(𝑟 ) and Head(𝑟 ), and C ⊆ leaves(B) is a (possibly empty)
subset of leaves, said constrained; C is also denoted Constrained(𝑟 );
𝐵 and 𝐻 share the same root, and, beside the root, only leaves
can be shared between B and H . The frontier of 𝑟 , denoted by
frontier (𝑟 ), is the set of nodes shared between B and H . Furthermore,
frontierleaves (𝑟 ) denotes the set of leaves of 𝑟 shared by B and H , i.e.,
frontierleaves (𝑟 ) = leaves(B)∩leaves(H ) ⊂ frontier (𝑟 ). In the formal
development, w.l.o.g, we assume no constants in the rules (in con-
trast with data and queries), that is, leavesV (B) = ∅ = leavesV (H ).
Consider again the rules in Figure 1. Rule 𝑟1 defines a high-
level notion of a push event. First, it verifies if structural conditions
defined by the body are met in the data. That is, that a key type with
value PushEvent is present, as well as an event id and the login of
the user who made the event. Then, it checks for constrained nodes
(marked with $ in the picture). That is, it verifies that id and login
are associated with terminal values of V. Finally, it computes the
result by copying these values within a new structure associated
with the key push. Rules 𝑟2 and 𝑟3 are similar. Rule 𝑟4 states that
the key push is a particular case of event. This rule is called a
relabeling rule. Rules 𝑟5 and 𝑟6 are similar. Note that all frontier
leaves are constrained in 𝑟1-𝑟3, and none in 𝑟4-𝑟6. Finally, a key
feature of rules is that they may have non-frontier nodes in the
head, called existential nodes. This is the case for 𝑟1-𝑟3 in Figure
1, where existential nodes are marked in red. These nodes allow
to reorganize extracted values into new structures. In this, our
framework is leaning towards Datalog±, which extends Datalog
with existentially quantified variables [16, 35].

Rule Semantics As Figure 1 illustrates, the application of rules
leads to an extended instance that we compactly see as a (rooted)
acyclic graph. This is to simplify the formal development, in that
acyclic graphs can always be unfolded into trees. Regardless, since
we will focus on query rewriting, these extended instances never
have to be computed, as they remain virtual. A trigger for a rule
𝑟 = (B, H, C) on an (extended) instance 𝐼 is a pair (𝑟, ℎ) where ℎ is a
(not necessarily rooted) homomorphism from B to 𝐼 respecting the
constrained nodes, i.e., such that ℎ(C) ⊆ leavesV (𝐼 ). The applica-
tion of (𝑟, ℎ) to 𝐼 results in 𝐼 ∪ ℎ+ (H ), where ℎ+ ⊇ ℎ is an extension
of ℎ mapping every non-frontier node of H to a fresh node. Given a
set of rules Π, we denote by 𝛼 (𝐼, Π) the instance obtained from 𝐼 by
applying all triggers on 𝐼 in parallel, i.e., 𝛼 (𝐼, Π) = 𝐼 ∪ ⋃︁
(𝑟,ℎ) ℎ+ (H )
where 𝑟 ∈ Π and (𝑟, ℎ) is a trigger on 𝐼 . Given an instance tree 𝑇 ,

2701

we define Sat0 (𝑇 , Π) = 𝑇 and Sat𝑖+1 (𝑇 , Π) = 𝛼 (Sat𝑖 (𝑇 , Π)). Finally,
the saturation of 𝑇 is Sat (𝑇 , Π) = ⋃︁∞
𝑖=0 Sat𝑖 (𝑇 , Π). This notion of
saturation is also known as chase [8] and is well-defined since the
order in which the rule applications are performed has no incidence
on the result (up to isomorphism).

Queries and Certain Answers A constrained tree-query is a
triple 𝑞 = (𝑇 , C, x) where 𝑇 is a tree, C ⊆ leaves(𝑇 ) is a set of
constrained leaves that must be mapped to valued nodes in the data,
and x ∈ C |x| is a sequence of answer nodes. We also denote C by
Constrained(𝑞) and x by AnswerSeq(𝑞). We assume valued leaves
are always constrained, i.e., leavesV (𝑇 ) ⊆ C. To illustrate, consider
the query 𝑞 in Figure 1. The only constrained node is the answer
node (marked by 𝑥). Hence, this node must be mapped to constant
values (here, “431” and “695”). A query 𝑞 is called Boolean if x = ().
A tuple a ∈ V |x| is an answer to a query 𝑞 over an extended
instance 𝐼 if there is a rooted homomorphism ℎ from 𝑇 to 𝐼 such
that 𝜆N ◦ ℎ (x) = a and ℎ(C) ⊆ leavesV (𝐼 ), i.e., the leaf constraint
is fulfilled. The set of answers to 𝑞 on 𝐼 is denoted by Ans(𝑞, 𝐼 ). A
tuple a is a (certain) answer to 𝑞 on 𝐼 and Π if it is an answer to
𝑞 on Sat (𝑇 , Π). The set of all answers to 𝑞 on (𝐼, Π) is denoted by
Ans(𝑞, 𝐼, Π). A query 𝑞 is more general than a query 𝑞′, denoted by
𝑞 ≥ 𝑞′, if there is a rooted homomorphism ℎ from 𝑇𝑞 to 𝑇 ′
𝑞 such
that ℎ(C𝑞) ⊆ C𝑞′ and ℎ(x𝑞) = x𝑞′. A classical query containment
property [8] holds here: 𝑞 ≥ 𝑞′ iff Ans(𝑞′, 𝐼 ) ⊆ Ans(𝑞, 𝐼 ), for all 𝐼 .
Query Rewritings. A sound and complete set of rewritings of 𝑞
wrt Π is a set of queries Q such that, for every instance 𝐼 , it holds
that Ans(𝑞, 𝐼, Π) = ⋃︁𝑞′ ∈Q Ans(𝑞′, 𝐼 ); in this equality, ⊇ expresses
soundness, and ⊆ completeness. In words, Q must embarck all
possible ways in which a query 𝑞 can be satisfied via the rules of Π.
For example, Figure 2 illustrates a sound and complete rewriting set
for 𝑞 of Example 1.1, made by the queries 𝑞, 𝑞1, 𝑞2, 𝑞3, 𝑞′
3. In
Section 3 we will show how our query rewriting algorithms exploit
two features of rules. First, rules are tree-shaped, and this makes
rewriting within the language of tree queries possible, thereby
fitting the requirements of NoSQL APIs (a property one can loose
beyond tree rules). Second, the applicability of a rule can be limited
via constrained leaves, which, as shown later, will pave the way
to decidability. As a last remark, note that, as the definition states,
a sound and complete set of rewritings Q is independent of any
input instance. This may lead to useless rewritings not matching the
data, like 𝑞, 𝑞1, 𝑞2, 𝑞3 over the trees in Figure 1. In Section 4 we will
present an instance-aware mechanism to prune these efficiently.

3 NEW QUERY REWRITING ALGORITHMS
As a first step towards effective query answering on NoSQL stores,
we give a query rewriting algorithm for (general) constrained tree-
rules. We revisit techniques developed for existential rules, based
on so-called piece-unifiers [16, 61], also reminiscent of view-based
query rewriting [71]. Roughly speaking, a unifier is a node substitu-
tion (i.e., a function replacing nodes with nodes) that, as the name
suggests, makes part of a query equal to part of a rule head. A piece-
unifier checks further structural constraints that are necessary for
the soundness of rewriting when the rule head features existential
nodes, as the rules 𝑟1-𝑟3 from Figure 1. Given a piece-unifier of a
query 𝑞 with a rule 𝑟 , a rewriting step produces a new query by
substituting the unified part of 𝑞 with the body of 𝑟 . Then, given a

2702

Figure 2: Query Rewriting Associated with Example 1.1

set of rules Π, a Π-rewriting of 𝑞 is a query obtained by a sequence
of rewriting steps with rules from Π. E.g., each query in Figure 2 is
a Π-rewriting of 𝑞, with Π the rule set of Figure 1.

The contribution of this work is to identify a restricted class
of piece-unifiers, called (semi-)twig-unifiers, which have the nice
property of producing tree-shaped rewritings as we sought.2 The
formal development of semi-twig query rewriting is presented in
Section 5. This tool allows us to compute a set of rewritings of a
query, whose soundness and completeness is stated as follows.

Theorem 3.1 (Soundness and Completeness of Rewriting).
For any query 𝑞, instance 𝑇 , and set of constrained tree-rules Π, a ∈
Ans(𝑞,𝑇 , Π) iff there is a Π-rewriting 𝑞′ of 𝑞 such that a ∈ Ans(𝑞′,𝑇 ).

Hence, semi-twig query rewriting allows one to compute a finite
sound and complete set of rewritings when such set exists. And
indeed, there are rule sets and queries that only admit infinite sound
and complete sets of rewritings (even modulo query containment).
This can happen already with simple rules, as shown by Figure 3.
Query 𝑞 searches for projects forkedFrom a repository owned by
the keras-team. By rewriting 𝑞 with the rules 𝑟1 and 𝑟2, one builds
paths of arbitrary length along the key from. All of the obtained
queries are incomparable to each other w.r.t. query containment,
hence the only sound and complete rewriting set here is infinite.
This raises the issue of algorithmic feasibility for query answering.

3.1 Taming Infinite Rewritings
In spite of an apparent simplicity, query answering with constrained
tree-rules is undecidable. This has been shown already for the spe-
cific case of (unconstrained) path rules in various settings [9, 28, 40].
This negative result opens the quest for decidable rule languages
for reasoning on JSON data. Strategies for recovering decidability
include the use of acyclicity notions or syntactic conditions ensur-
ing the termination of (forward or) backward chaining [16, 35, 46].
Here, we take a different approach. We consider a language with
non-terminating (both forward and) backward chaining, but ensur-
ing that the rewritings of a query can always be finitely captured.
We draw inspiration from the language of so-called suffix path-rules
proposed in [23] and lift it to the case of trees, which yields a specific
constrained tree-rule fragment we call frontier-constrained rules.
Crucially, this fragment makes the rewritings of a query forming a
regular tree-language one can capture with automata techniques.

2In passing, note we cannot use the query rewriting algorithm based on piece-unifiers
as-it-is, because 1) it may yield (more specific) rewritings that are not trees and 2) it
may not terminate when it should, as it does not take into account the shape of data.

constrained rules and 2) relabeling rules, which are defined next.

Definition 3.2. Let 𝑟 = (B, H, C) be a constrained tree-rule. Then:
• 𝑟 is frontier-constrained if frontierleaves (𝑟 ) ⊆ C
• 𝑟 is relabeling if B and H are edges and frontierleaves (𝑟 ) ≠ ∅
In Figure 1, 𝑟3-𝑟6 are frontier-constrained rules while 𝑟1-𝑟4 are
relabeling rules. Frontier-constrained rules impose that a trigger
maps all the frontier leaves of the rule to data values, but without any
further condition on the use of recursion. From a practical viewpoint,
they allow one to select values in the data and to reorganize them
into structures adapted to the targeted application. Relabeling rules
are among the most useful rules for reasoning on trees, as they
allow one to define hierarchies of keys. In contrast with frontier-
constrained rules, they apply anywhere on a tree instance.

The decidability of query answering for this fragment follows
from a natural translation into first-order logic. Constrained queries
and rules are translated into tree-shaped conjunctive queries and
existential rules, respectively. Frontier-constrained and relabeling
rules are more specifically translated into a decidable fragment
of existential rules called body-acyclic frontier-guarded [17]. For
this, we obtain that query answering is in ExpTime for combined
complexity [36]. Our framework can also be translated into a spe-
cific description logic, namely ELH V [63], which furthermore
allows one to derive a PTime upper bound for data complexity. Note
however that these complexity results do not make use of query
rewriting. By relying on the tree-automata rewriting described next,
we will design a query answering technique that effectively runs
in polynomial time w.r.t. the size of the data.

Capturing Infinite Rewritings With Automata A key fea-
ture of our (general) query rewriting algorithm is that, when rules
are frontier-constrained, it is ensured in any direct rewriting of 𝑞
that a single node is shared between the remaining part of 𝑞 and the
subtree coming from the rule body. Hence, we fall into an even more
specific case of unifiers we call twig-unifiers. As a consequence,
infinite sets of rewritings such as those illustrated in Figure 3 can
be captured by a tree automaton [44]. In a nutshell, the constructed
automaton is made of sub-automata that encode the initial query 𝑞
as well as all the specializations of rule bodies that can be involved
in a rewriting step. This set of sub-automata is finite as there is
a finite number of (non-equivalent) specializations for each rule
body. Transitions between states of different sub-automata allow to
encode rewritings. The detailed construction is provided in Section
6 and its adequacy now stated (follows by Theorem 6.2).

Theorem 3.3. Let Π be a set of frontier-constrained and relabel-
ing rules and 𝑞 be a query. Then, there exists a finite tree automaton
A recognizing a sound and complete set of rewritings of 𝑞 w.r.t. Π.

4 INSTANCE-AWARE EVALUATION
The automata approach gives us a ground for query answering
but still does not suffice, in practice, to exploit NoSQL databases.
Evidently, no database API will take an automaton as a query. Tree
queries are instead accepted. Concretely, this means that the au-
tomaton language has to be enumerated, and that every single query
in a rewriting set has to be evaluated. We are thus facing two issues.

Figure 3: Rules and Infinite Rewriting Sequences

First, we need to deal again with the case where rewriting sets are
infinite. Second, we need to cope with rewriting sets that are finite
but possibly large. To tackle these problems, we extend our query
rewriting approach to make it instance-aware, and more specifically
able to leverage on structural information of data for the sake of
query answering. Our approach consists in using a novel combina-
tion of 𝑖) summarization techniques to make rewritings finite and
𝑖𝑖) partitioning and parallelization techniques for efficiency.

Summarization. To always reduce rewritings to finite sound
and complete sets - for a given database instance - we use summaries
of data. In theory, it is sufficient to know the size of the data, as the
automaton allows one to enumerate queries by their size. So, once
exceeded the size of data, enumeration can be safely stopped. This
rough bound can be improved by considering only the depth of data
as nodes in a rewriting have a bounded outdegree (Theorem 6.2).
In practice, however, as rewriting is independent of the instance,
this can generate many queries that are not matching any data. So
we consider a data summary built on the set of maximal paths (root
to leaf), i.e., a dataguide [53]. When we enumerate the automaton
language we can use this information to discard some empty queries
by checking whether the tree query we are generating contains
an invalid path according to the summary. For instance, the set of
maximal paths of the trees in Figure 1 is

(date)
(id)
(payload · commits · author)

(type)

(actor · login)
(payload · issue · user)

Obviously, any rewriting featuring a path that is not in this list can
be discarded, as it will have no answer on the collection. Summaries
can sometimes be simplified when there is little ambiguity in the
data, by considering only the depth and the set of edge labels. For the
collection of Figure 1 these labels are {date, id, type, actor, login,
payload, commits, issue, author, user}. The label summary is less
precise but more compact. Paths can also be enriched with 𝑘-length
prefixes of the values found at their end. For instance, with 𝑘 = 5, we
can associate the value “gvanr” to path payload.commits.author
instead of gvanrossum. This can help in filtering queries which
use values not found in the data. Working with 𝑘-prefixes instead
of the values themselves enables more concise summaries while
retaining the precision of filtering. So, the path (dataguide), label,
and path+prefix will be the three main summaries we consider. All
can be used to filter empty queries in the automaton language, and
hence to reduce the (possibly infinite) set of rewritings of a query to
a finite and still complete set (for the given instance). Furthermore,

are typically of limited size. We will use the depth summary as a
baseline. We did not consider bisimilarity-based summaries [55] as
they tend to be quite large and more complex to compute; the label
and path summaries also proved to be quite effective.

Partitioning and Parallelization Even if finite, rewriting sets
can be hard to evaluate for any database because of the number of
queries they may contain. To improve the situation, our intuition
is that we must provide a mean to lead the single queries (within a
rewriting set) where the matching data is. With this aim, we define an
instance-aware reasoning strategy based on partitioning. In doing
so, we therefore introduce a pre-processing of a collection providing
means for the efficient evaluation of large rewriting sets.

Let 𝐽 = {𝑇1, . . . ,𝑇𝑛 } be a (single) collection of tree instances.
Our goal is to define a set of collections 𝐽1, . . . , 𝐽𝑘 making for a
partitioning of 𝐽 . We adopt a simple partitioning function oriented
towards rooted queries, defined as follows: Λ𝑑 (𝑇 ) = Π𝑑
𝑖=1labels𝑖 (𝑇 ).
The function Λ𝑑 (𝑇 ) concatenates the labels of edges at each level
(we denote by labels𝑖 (𝑇 ) the labels of edges going from level 𝑖−1
to level 𝑖 in 𝑇 ) up to the depth set by the parameter 𝑑; Λ𝑑 (𝑇 ) is
then mapped to an integer denoting the partition number of 𝑇 . So,
two trees 𝑇1,𝑇2 will be in the same partition 𝐽𝑖 if Λ𝑑 (𝑇1) = Λ𝑑 (𝑇2),
meaning that they just agree on the set of labels they use level-wise,
up to depth 𝑑. Note that for Λ𝑑 the number of partitions is not fixed
in advance, and rather depends on 𝑖) the data and 𝑖𝑖) the parameter 𝑑.
The function Λ𝑑 could also be replaced by more complex clustering
functions for trees also taking care of load balancing [10]; exploring
this range of possibilities is however beyond the scope of this work.
Note that Λ𝑑 (𝑇 ) can be computed in linear time at the moment
when data is loaded into the database.

The first net advantage of partitioning is that, instead of a rough
summarization for the whole collection, we can deploy a set of
narrower data-summaries, one for each partition 𝐽𝑖 . This obviously
leads to a greater filtering power. With this scheme, the queries
within a rewriting are more likely to be evaluated on the partitions
where they can have a match, according to the summary, instead of
being evaluated against the whole database. The use of rewriting,
summarization, and partitioning is shown in Figure 4: A rewrit-
ing automaton A(𝑞,Π) is built from a query 𝑞 and a set of rules Π.
A collection 𝐽 is partitioned into the collections 𝐽1, . . . , 𝐽𝑘 . For every
partition 𝐽𝑖 , the language of A(𝑞,Π) is filtered by Summary(𝐽𝑖 ). This
produces a finite set of queries Q
Partitioning can be implemented in several ways. Here, we con-
sider physical partitioning, where a distinct database collection is
built for every partition. Using a logical partitioning strategy is
discussed in [69] and proved to have similar effectiveness. Finally,
with partitioning in place, parallelization can further be added to
attack all of these partitions simultaneously by leveraging on the
concurrent data access facilities of the underlying database.

|Summary(𝐽𝑖 ) to evaluate on 𝐽𝑖 .

Let us point out that assuming data-awareness is not a strong
hypothesis in practice. For instance, data-awareness is implicit in
the fact of running a materialization algorithm. Also note that a
summary does not capture a single instance, but rather abstracts
over a class of instances. Instance-aware query rewriting is eval-
uated in Section 7. The following sections (5 and 6) present our
query rewriting algorithms.

5 SEMI-TWIG-BASED QUERY REWRITING
The goal of this section is to present semi-twig based unification
and query rewriting. As already mentioned, we revisit techniques
developed for existential rules, based on so-called piece-unifiers
[16, 61]. To begin, we need to introduce a key notion, that of
separating node. Let 𝑇 be a tree and 𝑆 be a subtree of 𝑇 . We denote
by (𝑇 \ 𝑆) the forest obtained by removing from 𝑇 all edges in
𝑆. Then, the nodes that belong to both 𝑆 and (𝑇 \ 𝑆) are said to
separate 𝑆 from 𝑇 . In other words, these are the nodes of 𝑆 that have
their parent or one of their children in (𝑇 \ 𝑆). Figure 5 pictures
a tree 𝑇 with four subtrees 𝑆1, 𝑆2,𝑇 ′,𝑇 ′′. The nodes marked with
S are separating for at least one subtree. The subtrees 𝑆1 (in blue),
𝑆2 (in brown) and 𝑇 ′ (in red) have the same root as 𝑇 . For all of
these subtrees the root is separating; indeed the root has other
children that do not belong to the subtree. The root of 𝑇 ′′ (in red)
is separating, this time because its parent does not belong to 𝑇 ′′.
Note that 𝑆2 also has a separating leaf and 𝑇 ′ also has a separating
internal node.

To simplify definitions, we now assume that the root of a rule
head has a single child. This can be done without loss of generality
since every rule can be decomposed into an equivalent set of rules
satisfying this assumption [69].

Definition 5.1 (Semi-twig). A subtree 𝑆 of 𝑇 is called semi-twig if:
(1) the root of 𝑆 has exactly one child
(2) any node separating 𝑆 from 𝑇 is either the root of 𝑆 or a leaf

of 𝑆 (i.e., no internal node of 𝑆 is separating).

A semi-twig without separating leaves is called a twig.

Consider again 𝑇 in Figure 5. Then, 𝑆1 is a twig as its only sepa-
rating node is the root, and 𝑆2 is a semi-twig as it has a separating
leaf. Finally, 𝑇 ′ and 𝑇 ′′ are not semi-twigs, since 𝑇 ′ has an internal
separating node and the root of 𝑇 ′′ has two children. The intuition
behind semi-twigs is that these are the parts of the query that can be
easily rewritten (Item (1)) while preserving tree-shaped rewritings
(Item (2)). We are now ready to define semi-twig unification.

Definition 5.2 (Semi-Twig Unification). A semi-twig-unifier 𝜇 for
a constrained query 𝑞 and a (general) constrained rule 𝑟 is a triple
(𝑆, H, 𝜈, 𝑢) where:
• 𝑆 is a semi-twig of 𝑞
• H is a rooted subtree of Head(𝑟 )
• 𝜈 is a leaf assignment for the nodes in frontierleaves (𝑟 )
• 𝑢 is a rooted homomorphism from 𝑆 to 𝜈 (H ) such that 𝑢 (𝑆) = 𝜈 (H )
and 𝑢 maps:
(1) each constrained leaf of 𝑆 to a frontier leaf of 𝑟
(2) each separating leaf of 𝑆 to an unconstrained frontier leaf of 𝑟 .

2704

Although the definition of semi-twig unification may seem some-
what involved, it is perfectly natural. The goal is to identify part
of the query (i.e., 𝑆) that is entailed by the application of the rule
𝑟 . Rewriting will then replace this part by a suitable specialization
of the body of 𝑟 that reflects the way in which the rule is applied.
This is captured first by the rooted homomorphism from 𝑆 to a leaf
assignment of H . This leaf assignment may only assign to a frontier
node in 𝑟 a value from 𝑆, since 𝑢 (𝑆) = 𝜈 (H ). By the homomorphism
𝑢, a leaf of 𝑆 is necessarily mapped to a leaf of H . Then, Conditions
(1) and (2) ensure the correctness of rewriting.

In the next definition of a direct rewriting, the union of the
trees 𝑢 (𝑞 \ 𝑆) and 𝜈 (Body(𝑟 )) is defined in the obvious way (i.e, by
making the union of the node sets, the edge sets and the functions)
and it can be checked that it results in a tree.

Definition 5.3 (Semi-Twig Rewriting). Let 𝜇 = (𝑆, H, 𝜈, 𝑢) be a
semi-twig-unifier for a constrained query 𝑞 and a (general) con-
strained rule 𝑟 . A direct rewriting of 𝑞 with 𝜇 is a query 𝑞rew =
(𝑇 , C, x) such that:

• 𝑇 = 𝑢 (𝑞 \ 𝑆) ∪ 𝜈 (Body(𝑟 ))
• C = 𝑢 (Constrained(𝑞)) ∪ Constrained(𝑟 )
• x = 𝑢 (AnswerSeq(𝑞)).

Proposition 5.4 (Closedness). 𝑞rew is a constrained tree query.

Let us come back to Conditions (1) and (2) of semi-twig unifica-
tion and illustrate them with the query 𝑞 and rules 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 from
Figure 5. Both rules have a constrained leaf in their body. This leaf
is frontier for 𝑟1, but not for 𝑟2. Hence, an application of 𝑟1 only
brings a new edge, while an application of 𝑟2 also brings a new
node. One could consider unifying the semi-twig 𝑆 ′
1 constituted by
the sole edge labeled by a. Note that the leaf of 𝑆 ′
1 is separating,
hence can only be mapped to an unconstrained frontier leaf. Uni-
fying 𝑆 ′
1 with 𝑟1 would violate Condition (2) because the frontier
leaf of 𝑟1 is constrained (and the associated rewriting would not
be a well-formed query, as it would have an internal constrained
node). Unifying 𝑆 ′
1 with 𝑟2 would also violate Condition (2) because
the leaf of Head(𝑟2) is not frontier (and the associated rewriting
would not be a well-formed query, as it would be disconnected, and
would furthermore be unsound). Now, consider the twig 𝑆 ′
2. It can
. However, 𝑆 ′
be unified with 𝑟1 thereby yielding the query 𝑞rew
𝑟1
2
cannot be unified with 𝑟2 because Condition (1) would be violated
(and the associated rewriting would be unsound).

1, ..., 𝜇𝑘, 𝑞′

Finally, we say that 𝑞rew is a Π-rewriting of 𝑞 if there is a sequence
𝑞 = 𝑞0, 𝜇1, 𝑞′
𝑘 = 𝑞rew such that 𝑞𝑖 is a direct rewriting of
𝑖 = (𝑞𝑖 )safe, where ·safe is a
𝑞𝑖−1 with 𝜇𝑖 using a rule of Π and 𝑞′
function replacing all nodes of 𝑞𝑖 by fresh nodes (1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑘). This
is merely a technicality, but it is needed to avoid multiple uses of
the same node if 𝑟 is used multiple times in a rewriting sequence.
The soundness and completeness of query rewriting ensures that
for any query 𝑞, instance 𝑇 , and set of constrained tree-rules Π,
a ∈ Ans(𝑞,𝑇 , Π) if and only if there is a Π-rewriting 𝑞′ of 𝑞 such
that a ∈ Ans(𝑞′,𝑇 ) (as stated by Theorem 3.1). From this, we can
easily build a breadth-first query rewriting operator in the spirit
of [61] that terminates if and only the query admits a finite sound
and complete set of rewritings. However, this still leaves the case of
infinite rewritings open. An important remark can be made about

which we will focus in the next section.

Remark 1. Let (𝑆, H, 𝜈, 𝑢) be a semi-twig unifier for a query 𝑞 and

a frontier-constrained rule 𝑟 . Then, 𝑆 must be a twig.

For instance, in Figure 5, both rules are frontier-constrained,

6 AUTOMATA-BASED QUERY REWRITING
Frontier-constrained rules do not ensure the finiteness of rewriting
sets (nor of saturation). However, they have the following key
property: the rewriting set of a query under frontier-constrained rules
can be characterized by a regular tree language. This means that
it can be compactly represented by a tree automaton. Frontier-
constrained tree rules generalize context-free path rules in [23]
which are in turn related to suffix-rewriting systems [42, 72]. What
paves the way for regularity is that frontier-constrained rules make
any semi-twig unifier for the query to be necessarily a twig-unifier
(Remark 1). Another important insight is that adding relabeling
rules (which, in contrast, requires semi-twig unifiers that may not
be twig unifiers) still preserves regularity, and so both types of
rules can be taken into account jointly. The goal of this section is
to present the construction of the automaton A(𝑞,Π) recognizing a
sound and complete set of rewritings for a query 𝑞 against a set of
rules Π.

We start by posing the notion of tree automaton needed to cap-
ture the rewritings of a query. This follows standard models [44]
adapted to the case of unordered trees.

Definition 6.1 (Automaton). A bottom-up automaton for

unordered trees is a tuple A = (Σ, S, L, F , Δ) where:

• Σ is an alphabet
• S is a set of states made of
S𝐸 a set of edge-states

and S𝑁 a set of node-states

• L, F ⊆ S𝑁 are sets of initial (leaves) and final (root) states
• Δ is a set of transitions made of

× S𝑁

ΔL ⊆ (︁Σ ∪ {𝜖})︁ × L
Δ𝐸 ⊆ S𝑁 × Σ × S𝐸
Δ𝑁 ⊆ 2S𝐸

a set of leaf nodes transitions
a set of edge transitions
a set of (non-leaf) node transitions
A run of A on 𝑇 = (N, E, 𝑡, 𝜆E, 𝜆N) is a function 𝜌 : N → S𝑁
that agrees with the transition rules of A, in the following sense.
• Every unlabeled leaf ℓ of 𝑇 is recognized by a ΔL-transition
𝜖
−→ 𝜌 (ℓ)
• Every labeled leaf ℓ of 𝑇 is recognized by a ΔL-transition

• Every (non-leaf) node 𝑛 of 𝑇 with children 𝑛1, . . . , 𝑛𝑘 is rec-

ognized by the following Δ-transitions

provided that s𝑖 ≠ s𝑗 for all 1≤𝑖≠𝑗 ≤𝑘

𝜌 (𝑛𝑖 )

• The root 𝑡 of 𝑇 is such that 𝜌 (𝑡) is a final state in F

An automaton defines a language (or set) of unordered trees L(A).
The automata framework represents tree languages, but is insen-
sitive to query features such as constrained and answer nodes. So, to
proceed, we must define an encoding of a query 𝑞 as a “plain” tree
encode(𝑞) that can manipulated by automata. The idea of the en-
coding is to store information on constrained and answer leaf nodes
as values. The encoding must essentially cover three cases. The first
is where the leaf is unconstrained. The second is where the leaf is
constrained but does not belong to the answer sequence. The third
is where the leaf belongs to the answer sequence (so, by definition,
is also constrained). Figure 6 (left) shows a query 𝑞′ as well as its
corresponding automaton Aencode(𝑞′) . The query seeks for forked
projects (forkee) for all records describing a ForkEvent which
also includes the project from which fork originated (forkedFrom).
The query has three leaf nodes, which are recognized by three
initial states of the automaton. Each initial state is used to define
𝑣𝑖
where 𝑣𝑖 is the encoding
a non-leaf node transition ∅

of a query leaf. State sinitial

its encoding is 𝑣1 = ($ · ForkEvent) where the reserved symbol $

encoded as 𝑣2 = ($ · 1), where 1 denotes the position of the answer
variable in the answer node sequence. State sinitial

existential node. This is encoded as 𝑣3 = (#) where # denotes that
the node is not constrained. Moving on, the initial states are used

to define three edge transitions of the form sinitial

𝑘1 = type, 𝑘2 = forkee, and 𝑘3 = forkedFrom. Each transition
recognizes an edge of the query. Finally, the non-leaf node transi-
tion {e1, e2, e3} −→ sfinal allows Aencode(𝑞′) to recognize the whole
tree. Due to space constraints, the formal construction of the au-
tomata encoding of queries is detailed in [69]. The example of
Figure 6 illustrates that it is straightforward to build an automaton
A𝑇 recognizing a tree 𝑇 which is also minimal (i.e., without useless
state or transition). We can do so by creating distinct states and
transitions for every (1) node label, (2) edge, and (3) internal node
of 𝑇 . This handling of (un)constrained, valued, and answer nodes,
also extends to the encoding of rule bodies introduced from single
rewriting steps [69]. In the remainder of the section, the encoding
of a query 𝑞 and of a rule body 𝐵 specialized by a unifier 𝜇 are
denoted by encode(𝑞) and encode(𝜇 (𝐵)), respectively. This is at
the basis of the rewriting process described next.

Building the Rewriting Automaton Remind that our goal is
to construct an automaton A(𝑞,Π) recognizing the set of rewritings
of a query 𝑞 against a set of rules Π. For clarity, we present the
construction of A(𝑞,Π) in two steps. First, we provide a declarative
construction, showing (𝑖) the main steps of the process as well as
its connections to the general query rewriting from Section 5 and
(𝑖𝑖) the finiteness of A(𝑞,Π) . In the second step, we outline how to
also achieve a terminating algorithm.

Figure 6: Query and Rewriting Automata

A

Figure 7 presents the construction of the rewriting automaton
A(𝑞,Π) . In there, we do some standard assumptions. First, when
constructing an automaton A𝐵 from a specialized rule body, we use
a fresh set of states. The Extend operation makes the union of two
automata A(𝑞,Π) = (Σ, S, L, F , Δ) and A𝐵 = (Σ𝐵, S𝐵, L𝐵, F𝐵, Δ𝐵)
but gives precedence to the final state of A(𝑞,Π) by returning (Σ ∪
Σ𝐵, S ∪ S𝐵, L ∪ L𝐵, F , Δ ∪ Δ𝐵). Finally, as we work with automata

that have a single final state, we denote by sfinal
Figure 6 (right) illustrates the rewriting of the query 𝑞 presented
in Figure 3 with rules 𝑟1 and 𝑟2. Recall that query 𝑞 searches for
projects forkedFrom a repository owned by the keras-team. The
query has an infinite rewriting set, which is captured as follows. The
process starts by initializing A(𝑞,Π) as the automaton for encode(𝑞).
A twig-unifier 𝜇 for 𝑟2 and 𝑞 is found (steps 3 and 4). Remark that 𝜇
unifies a twig of the query (actually, the path forkedFrom.owner)
with a twig of the rule head. This leads to the extension of A(𝑞,Π)
with a fresh sub-automaton for encode(𝜇 (Body(𝑟2))) (step 5). Also
this yields a a novel non-leaf node transition {e1, e2, e5}−→sfinal
𝑞
(step 6) resulting from replacing e3 by e5 in {e1, e2, e3}−→sfinal
. In
Figure 6, abusing of notation, we picture this with an edge from e5
to e3. At this point, b the relabeling rule 𝑟1 is applied to the fresh
sub-automaton (step 2). This in turn yields a new twig-unifier 𝜇 ′ for
𝑟2 (steps 3, 4). As encode(𝜇 (Body(𝑟2))) = encode(𝜇 ′(Body(𝑟2))),
no extension of A(𝑞,Π) is performed at this time (step 5). However,
c a novel non-leaf node transition {e5}−→s5 (step 6) capturing
the infinite recursion stemming from the rules 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 is added.
The correctness of the construction is now stated [69].

𝑞

Theorem 6.2 (Soundness and Completeness). Let Π be a set of
frontier-constrained and relabeling rules. For every tree 𝑇 and query 𝑞
we have that ⋃︁
encode(𝑞′) ∈L(A(𝑞,Π) ) Ans(𝑇 , 𝑞′) = Ans(𝑇 , 𝑞, Π). Also,
A(𝑞,Π) is finite and its language is made by trees of bounded rank.

All-at-Once Twig-Unification To turn our declarative con-
struction into a terminating algorithm we have to provide a finite
procedure for the enumeration of all possible queries and twig-
unifiers (steps 3 and 4) which may loop when A(𝑞,Π) recognizes
an infinite language. And indeed, it is possible to manipulate these
unifiers all-at-once by directly working on the states of A(𝑞,Π) . So,
instead of considering every possible query 𝑞′ recognized by A(𝑞,Π)
and every possible twig 𝑆 of 𝑞′ we do the following. First, we iterate
on the (finite) set of rooted twigs H that belong to the head of
the rules in Π. Then, for each H , we iterate on the (finite) set of
node-states s of A(𝑞,Π) . For every H and s, we check if A(𝑞,Π) (s)

(that is, the automaton A(𝑞,Π) where the final state is set to be s)
recognizes a tree 𝑇 such that 𝑆 is a rooted twig of 𝑇 and there are 𝑢
and 𝜈 such that 𝑢 (𝑆) = 𝜈 (H ). Because H is finite this can be done
in a finite number of steps. In this way, we can capture all uni-
fiers 𝜇 representing a possibly infinite class of unifiers. Once A(𝑞,Π)
built, it is possible to perform a single post-order traversal of an
instance 𝑇 to compute answer to queries [69]. This adapts classical
validation algorithms from [44]. Follows a PTime data-complexity
upper-bound for query answering. The construction is independent
from data. Moreover, it can be boostrapped independently from
queries. Indeed, the unifiers that hold between the rules only, as
those for 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 in Figure 6, can be precomputed off-line thus
reducing rewriting costs at query time.

7 EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
Implementation We implemented our approach for reasoning
over document stores in a Java 11 tool: TreeForce (TF). This library
can be seen as a general toolbox for implementing reasoning tech-
niques for tree-shaped data and rules. The tool has been coded from
scratch. It is composed of two main modules. The first includes
generic data structures and algorithms for trees and tree-automata.
The second includes our instance-aware query rewriting and evalu-
ation methods. TreeForce also includes a translation module tied to
the target DBMS. We deployed our system on top of a well-known
NoSQL database: MongoDB (v5.0.8). Our approach can be ported
to systems supporting constrained tree-queries, which is a basic
requirement for many stores [1, 3, 4, 25, 58, 70]. Query translation
as well as the deployment on other systems is discussed in [69].

Environment We performed all experiments on a machine with
an AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT CPU (4.7 Ghz, 12 cores), 128GB DDR4
2400Mhz memory and 2TB SSD disk, running KDE neon on ext4 FS.
By relying on MongoDB, TreeForce has modest memory require-
ments. We allocated only 10GB memory to the JVM (jdk16). We
used MongoDB standard configuration with 8GB cache size.

Benchmarks used for our study are shown in Table 1. We de-
fined three benchmarks from known benchs: DBLPJR, GitHubJR

and XMarkJR (JR, for JSON Reasoning). DBLP and GitHub are large
corpus of real data. XMark, in contrast, is a synthetic benchmark but
equipped with a data generator that helped us in better understand-
ing the scalability question. Both DBLP and XMark come as XML;
they have been translated into JSON to feed document stores. These
systems are oriented towards the exploitation of limited size records
(e.g., 16MB for MongoDB). So, XML trees have been shredded into
a collection of JSON records in a standard way, that is, by record-
ing the main objects of the original data in different records (e.g.,
one record per publication in DBLPJR). DBLPJRand GitHubJR are
tests over several million real world records. For DBLPJR we used
22 queries containing a mix of tree queries of different complexity
inspired from those in [30, 32, 52]. We manually defined a set of
51 rules with 15 frontier-constrained rules and 36 relabeling rules
inspired both from the DBLP ontology (dblp.org/rdf/schema) and
[30]. For GitHubJR we defined 5 queries of different complexity and
54 tree-rules including 40 frontier-constrained and 14 relabeling.
Overall, these allowed us to gauge our approach on real voluminous
data. XMarkJR includes a set of 115 distinct JSON collections (up
to several million records), 23 rulesets (containing 5 to 62 relabeling
rules), and 10 queries. XMarkJR is an extension of the well-known
XMark [75] we designed to dispose of a rule-based query answering
benchmark over trees to understand the scalability of our approach.
First, XMarkJR allows us to control the number of rewritings of a
query - which is a crucial parameter. We consider 23 rulesets each
creating a larger number of rewritings per query (from 1 to 500).
Second, it allows us to control the size and variability of data. So
for, each ruleset, we considered five collections (see Table 1), with
the larger collection having 1.4B edges when data is seen as trees.
We refer to [69] for its detailed presentation. Overall, XMarkJR is
meant to push the limits of rewriting-based query answering.

Other systems. We are not aware of any system for reasoning
with constrained-tree rules on top of JSON data. However, as our
rules can be encoded as Datalog± rules [16, 34] we used reasoners
for Datalog± designed for knowledge-graphs as a baseline.
Materialization-based approaches. We used VLog [41] via Rulewerk
[5] to study in-memory materialization. VLog is a high-performance
state-of-the-art reasoner [11]. As it runs in-memory, it gives us a
point on absolute performance to evaluate DBMS-based approaches.
Rewriting-based approaches. Graal is the only rewriting-based sys-
tem for Datalog± we are aware of [15, 62]. We used a recent major
version of the tool [6]. Graal is a modular system that allows one to
parametrize the storage and reasoning algorithms. So, we leveraged
on Graal’s modularity to study three rewriting-based strategies,
as follows. In all three cases, we used Graal to compute (finite)
rewritings of queries - whenever possible. Then, rewritings were
evaluated in two different ways. The first is in-memory, again with
VLog. The second is with PostgreSQL (v14.7); data was stored as a

of the rewriting sets and in the size of the data. This is expected as
the evaluation algorithm of MongoDB is based on a database scan.
This observation is also confirmed on DBLPJR and GitHubJR.

Summary-based Filtering is Critical. Figure 9 shows average
query answering times for the depth, label, path and path+prefix
summaries for DBLPJR and GitHubJR. It reports both the query
rewriting and the evaluation time. For the path+prefix summary, we
fixed 𝑘 = 5, i.e., prefixes have length 5. We also tested longer prefixes
but this did not bring any sensible improvement. For DBLPJR, the
label summary leads to an average speedup of 3x on a single query.
This raises to 5x for the path summary and to 23x when 𝑘-prefixes
are added. For GitHubJR, the label summary leads to a speedup of
4x on average, which raises to 17x for the path summary. While
for GitHubJR prefixes did not improve much things, for DBLPJR
queries with text values, gains with 𝑘-prefixes can be in orders of
magnitude for single queries [69]. Overall, it is unavoidable to use
data summaries for efficiency as the underlying database system
is unable to discard empty queries based on their structure, which
slows down performances. Summaries have no effect on XMarkJR,
which by design produces almost no empty queries, and forces
the underlying database to evaluate all queries in a rewriting set.
However, summaries will have again the same powerful filtering
role combined with partitioning, as discussed next. As a last remark,
summaries were relatively lightweight for DBLPJR and GitHubJR.
For DBLPJR, they included 50 labels, 188 paths, and 957K 5-prefixes
while GitHubJR had 250 labels, 991 paths, and 3.3M 5-prefixes.

Evaluation Dominates Query Rewriting Costs. Recall that
query rewriting is divided in 1) automaton construction and 2)
summary-based filtering and query generation. As expected, the
query rewriting time depends on the complexity of rules and the
size of the resulting rewriting set [69]. For DBLPJR, the average
automaton construction time was 300ms and within 1 second even
for thousands of rewritings. For GitHubJR the average automaton
construction time was 1.5s and within 3.5 seconds. For XMarkJR, it
was within 0.1 seconds in general. After the automaton construc-
tion follow filtering and query generation. Rewriting generation
was on average in the order of tens of milliseconds and within
200ms for large rewritings, across all benchmarks. Figure 9 allows
one to compare the rewriting time (automaton construction+query
generation) and the evaluation time of a rewriting set, with different
data summaries. The main observation is that for large volumes of
data query answering is likely to be dominated by the evaluation
of a rewriting-set rather than by rewriting itself. Also, automaton
construction could be boostrapped off-line as discussed in Section
6 further reducing rewriting costs at query time.

Partitioning and Parallelization Bring Big Improvements.
For partitioning, we used the Λ𝑑 function with 𝑑 = 2 (Section 4).
This led to 8 partitions for DBLPJR, 30 for GitHubJR, and between 6
and 130 for XMarkJR. We report the results for the path summary
without prefixes. We use this as a yardstick to show that partitioning
and parallelization have sensible effects; gains cannot decrease
when prefixes are added. Recall we focus on physical partitioning;
we found logical partitioning having similar effectiveness [69].

For DBLPJR, we start by looking at the gain provided by parti-
tioning alone (i.e., without parallelization), as illustrated in Figure
10 (TF-part-path). The advantage of partitioning alone is that 𝑖) a

knowledge graph by using indexed property-tables [52] and integer
encoding [81] and tree-queries were translated as SQL queries. As
scaling integer encoding can be challenging, we also considered a
PostgreSQL storage without integer encoding.

MongoDB Wrapper Queries have been translated into Mon-
goDB with the find() facility which answers true on every record
of the collection satisfying a query by returning the record itself.
It is also worth noting that for all benchmarks we considered tree-
queries without answer variables. However, this does not make
evaluation easy, as we still ask MongoDB to check if each record
satisfies the query. To gauge performances across different sys-
tems we asked the competitors compute the set of trees matching a
query as for our system. We focused on the computational effort
needed for evaluating constrained tree-queries: no input time (i.e.,
data loading) nor output time (i.e. result serialization) were consid-
ered. Inputs were translated into formats recognizable by the other
systems (JSON data as CSV, tree queries and rules as DLGP [14]).
Overview of the Results We will focus on two aspects. First,
a study of the query answering techniques we proposed, then a
comparison with the other systems. For space limits, we focus on
the main findings and report average query times. Detailed times
are reported in [69]. Results are robust averages over 5 repetitions.
All times are in seconds. Experiments with the TreeForce system
will be denoted by "TF". The baseline approach for our system
uses the depth-summary, this is denoted by TF-depth. Variants of
our system with different summaries introduced in Section 4 are
denoted TF-{label,path,path+prefix}. We denote by TF-part-parall-
path our method with partitioning and parallelization, with the
path summary; this is our best resulting approach. The variant of
this technique without parallelization is denoted by TF-part-path.
Linear Scalability of the Underlying Database. Figure 8 il-
lustrates how MongoDB reacts to the evaluation of 1) larger rewrit-
ing sets on 2) larger volumes of data produced by XMarkJR. Every
data point indicates the time taken for evaluating a rewriting set.
We can clearly see that the response time is linear both in the size

2708

query is evaluated on smaller portions of the database and 𝑖𝑖) parti-
tions can be skipped when the data summary rules out any answer
on a specific partition. In this experiment, partitions are queried
sequentially and times added up. For DBLPJR queries that took
more than 200ms (20 out 22) the average speedup for (sequentially)
querying the partition was of 16.1x; the value increases if all 22
queries are considered [69]. For GitHubJR, the average speedup was
30x. By introducing parallelization (TF-part-parall-path) the run-
time is dominated by the time of querying the “slowest” partition
(to which we add the management of the parallel data access). So,
the gains further raise to 22.9x for (again: 20 out of 22) DBLP queries
and 53x for GitHubJR wrt the baseline TF-depth. For comparison,
recall that the path summary had an average speedup of 5.5x (on
all 22 queries) on DBLPJR, and of 17.6x on GitHubJR, which means
partitioning and parallelization allow one to go 2x to 4x faster wrt
the path summary alone on these datasets. As said above, we re-
ported on the path summary to have a yardstick for performances.
Interestingly, we found the label summary on DBLPJR to provide
essentially the same results [69]. This is because partitions have
a reduced variability of data, hence labels are used with less am-
biguity. So, summaries can be both very small and efficient when
combined with partitioning. As expected, adding prefixes to the
path summary improves the filtering power and reduces the size of
rewritings. This can again further improve the speed-up by at least
3x on DBLPJR with respect to using partitioning, parallelization
and the path summary without 𝑘-prefixes. Overall, these results
show the gains provided by partitioning and parallelization.

Partitioning Leads Towards Horizontal Scalability. Parti-
tioning and parallelization can be extremely efficient in distributing
the query answering effort on large databases. Figure 11 (left) re-
ports answering times on an XMarkJR ruleset generating rewritings
of size 100 over several instances. Data points indicate the average
query time for the 10 XMarkJR queries. Let us focus on two vari-
ants of our system: the baseline (TF-depth) and with partitioning,
parallelization, and the path summary (TF-part-parall-path). While
for small data the two are closer, gains can reach peaks of two
orders of magnitude for single queries on large JSON collections.
The average gain on 100M is 2x (over all 23 rulesets), and raises
13.5x on 1G and to 68.2x for 10GB and to 88.8x for 50G. Figure 11
(right) reports single query time with TF-part-parall-path for 10GB
and 50G XMarkJR data (note, across all rulesets). We observe that
the greater is the number of partitions attacked by a query, the
lower is the query evaluation time, as the querying effort can be
better distributed. For 10GB data we can answer queries with 100
rewritings in 1.3 seconds, which is encouraging. This suggests that
other partitioning functions could achieve better load balancing
leading towards horizontal scalability; this is left for future work.
No Stored Inferences and Low Memory Consumption Our
method achieves both efficiency and scalability thanks the underly-
ing database. Its persistent storage enables querying on large data,
and query rewriting avoids to store any inference. Let us go back
to Figure 11 (left), showing average query times for rewriting sets
of size 100. Experiments confirm that in-memory materialization
with VLog is extremely efficient, especially on small to medium
instances, because of its dedicated algorithms and data-structures.
TreeForce with partitioning, parallelization, and path summary is

Figure 10: Answering Time (average) - Rewriting Systems

Figure 11: Answering Time: (left) Systems (right) Partitions

slower on small instances but, as data increases, it reaches similar
performances (already for 𝜂 = 100). This was confirmed also on
XMarkJR ruleset generating rewritings of size 10 and 500 [69]. For
𝜂 = 500, VLog could not load the data as it consumed all of the
RAM we allocated. This shows that in-memory solutions may re-
quire powerful hardware for their deployment on large datasets,
while relying on database solutions allows one to scale with modest
memory resources. For DBLP and GitHub the average query time
for VLog was 5.9s on DBLP (against 7.4s for TF-part-parall-path)
and 0.7s on GitHubJR (against 2.2s for TF-part-parall-path). For a
fair comparison, this data does not include the time taken by VLog
to apply the rules alone (without computing answers to queries)
which can be considered either a one-of operation or not. We report
however that rule application time was 160s for DBLP and 65s for
GitHubJR (no input nor output time). We conclude that for one-of
operations our approach can be relevant also on smaller instances.
Finally, note that VLog rule-application is negligible for XMarkJR
as relabeling rules are kept intensional [57]; this makes the compar-
ison of Figure 11 meaningful. All of this is interesting also because
a DBMS can be considered at disadvantage when compared with
main-memory solutions in terms of pure response time.

Rewriting Algorithms Tailored for Data-Tree. For GitHubJR
and XMarkJR, we could use Graal to compute rewritings of queries.
However, this was not possible for all DBLPJR queries as the transla-
tion of DBLPJR tree also yields Datalog± rules which are recursive.
Indeed, rewriting with Graal terminated only on 6 queries out of
22. Note that this is not a limitation of this tool, but of any general
rewriting algorithm that makes no hypothesis on the shape of data.
In contrast, our rewriting algorithm tailored for tree rules termi-
nated in all cases. Hence, times reported next for rewriting-based
approaches on DBLPJR only consider those 6 queries.

The main feature of interest of rewriting-based systems is their
frugality in terms of main memory. However, they may face other
challenges when scaling out reasoning. The first, is the evaluation of
large rewriting sets, which is a well-known issue [33]. The second
is computing dictionary encoding over large collections, which

2709

is a question in itself [81]. Figure 10 illustrates rewriting-based
approaches on DBLPJR andGitHubJR showing the effectiveness of
our optimizations. XMarkJR results for rewriting-based systems are
reported in Figure 11. We include only average times for the cases
where all of the 10 XMarkJR queries were answered by a system
[69]. For 𝜂 = 500, again data could not be loaded in main memory
by VLog. On the other side, Graal could not encode the data, as the
dictionary encoding computation ran out of memory. By disabling
dictionary encoding data was loaded into PostgreSQL. However,
already for 𝜂 = 100, disabling encoding did not allow to answer all
the queries of the benchmark (recall, each with 100 rewritings). Our
approach, in both its baseline and optimized versions, was able to
provide answers across all benchmarks. Overall, we believe these
results on rewriting over MongoDB to be very promising.

8 RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSION
There has been little work on reasoning on top of JSON databases.
Prior work studied path-rules for JSON [23, 67]; we focus on tree-
rules. More specifically, our frontier-constrained tree-rules extend
the context-free fragment of suffix-path rules from [23], while keep-
ing suitability for query rewriting on document-stores. Still on the
theoretical level, the work of [26, 56] focuses on the computational
complexity of some logical query languages for JSON. Note that
the frameworks from [23, 26, 56, 67] have not been implemented.
Another line of work considers the definition of virtual RDF views
of JSON data as well as reasoning with RDFS/OWL ontologies at
the RDF level [24, 31, 32]; we do reasoning at the JSON level.

With respect to the area of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs,
constrained tree-rules allow for existential nodes in the rule head:
these are analogous to existentially quantified variables in Datalog±
[16, 19, 34]. As already said, our decidable fragment can be seen
as a strict subset of body-acyclic frontier-guarded existential rules
[17], as well as of the description logic ELH V [63]. Many reason-
ers have been implemented for knowledge graphs. State-of-the-art
materialization-based systems include in-memory solutions like
VLog [41], RDFox [68] and Vadalog [20] (the latter being restricted
to a specific rule fragment) and RDBMS-based solutions like LLu-
natic [51] and DLV [12]. Note that materialization does not always
halt for frontier-constraint tree-rules. State-of-the-art rewriting-
based systems include OnTop [37] and Mastro [39], both devoted
to lightweight OWL ontologies incomparable with our rules, and
Graal for existential rules [15]. Note that Graal accepts any set of
existential rules and conjunctive query, but query rewriting termi-
nates only if the rewriting set is finite [61], a property that is not
fulfilled by frontier-constrained tree-rules (recall Figure 3). Also,
our query rewriting technique based on semi-twig-unifiers exploits
the fact that data is tree-shaped and generates only tree queries.

Various formalisms for reasoning on XML and object-oriented
databases have been studied [7, 18, 27, 29, 45, 60, 65, 74]. A differ-
ence between our framework and most of these proposals is that
they are tied to XML and XPath. Among the rule-based languages
for XML, decidable fragments such as XPathLog [65], Elog [18]
and F-Logic [59, 60], which do not allow for existential nodes, are
incomparable with our frontier-constrained tree-rules in terms of
expressivity. Another sharp difference is that [7, 18, 60, 65] have

been designed with a forward-chaining reasoning in mind; our
focus is query rewriting. Xcerpt [74] is the closest language to
our tree-rules for which backward chaining (over ordered trees)
has been studied [73]. Our work differs as [73, 74] provides no
guarantees for the termination of Xcerpt rules, while we identify
a decidable fragment via query rewriting (over unordered trees).
Active XML [7] is not based on rules but on function calls. UnQL
[29] and XML-QL [45] are not rule-languages but query-languages
based on recursive functions. Although these approaches can be
assimilated with ours, their technical development is quite different.
A last crucial difference with all these proposals is that our work is
the first to consider (and implement) the use of NoSQL document
stores to support rule-based query answering over data-trees.

Rewriting-based techniques have been considered for answer-
ing queries over virtual XML views defined either from SQL data
[49, 50, 77] or XML data [47, 48, 79] to support data-integration
and secure access to information. Note first that view languages are
different from rule languages, which are typically more general. Au-
tomata have been proved effective for tackling problems related to
XML queries in many settings [44, 76]. Very few work considers the
presence of recursion in the definition of views. From the automata
perspective, the work of [48] is the closest to ours in spirit as it
considers automata-based rewriting for regular XPath queries over
recursive XML views. However, the decidable language stemming
from recursive view definitions is much closer to [18, 60, 65] which
makes it orthogonal to frontier-constrained tree-rules. Further, [48]
produces regular-XPath rewritings which are not supported by any
system and calls for an ad-hoc implementation. In contrast, our
instance-aware method outputs tree-queries and relies on efficient
NoSQL systems. To conclude on this matter, note that the prob-
lem of answering queries with materialized views [54] (the input
query targets the source database, rewritings target the views) is
opposite to the one with virtual views (the input query targets
the virtual database, rewritings target the source database). Our
approach can nevertheless benefit from the presence of material-
ized views containing certain answers to queries over the original
database. Having materialized views opens for two types of oppor-
tunities. First, evaluating a subset of the rewriting-set of a query
on the materialized views. Second, the development of early stop
techniques for our rewriting algorithms when answers to single
rewritings (over views) are found. The study of these questions is
however left as the subject of future work.

In conclusion, we have shown that NoSQL stores can be used to
build an efficient and scalable tool for reasoning on JSON databases.
We have outlined the importance of instance-aware query rewriting
techniques and shown that the combination of data summaries, par-
titioning and parallelization result in high performances on large
data. We believe that some of these ideas can be transposed to the
case of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs. Future work also in-
cludes the extension to more expressive rule languages, for example
including suitable forms of equality constraints and contexts.
