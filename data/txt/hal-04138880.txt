ABSTRACT
We consider the problem of automatically inferring the (LATEX)
document class used to write a scientific article from its PDF rep-
resentation. Applications include improving the performance of
information extraction techniques that rely on the style used in
each document class, or determining the publisher of a given scien-
tific article. We introduce two approaches: a simple classifier based
on hand-coded document style features, as well as a CNN-based
classifier taking as input the bitmap representation of the first page
of the PDF article. We experiment on a dataset of around 100k arti-
cles from arXiv, where labels come from the source LATEX document
associated to each article. Results show the CNN approach signifi-
cantly outperforms that based on simple document style features,
reaching over 90% average F1-score on a task to distinguish among
several dozens of the most common document classes.

1 INTRODUCTION
The majority of research papers in fields such as mathematics,
physics and computer science are written using the LATEX docu-
ment composition system. LATEX documents have a document class,
which defines the type of document to be generated and how it is
styled. The standard LATEX document classes include article, book
and report, but many others have been defined and are included
in modern LATEX distributions. In particular, many publishers of
academic journals and conference proceedings created specific doc-
ument classes, to define their own document structure standards,
and to get a uniform style for all the papers in a given conference
or journal. For instance, the current paper was generated using the
acmart document class, which is commonly used to write articles
for venues sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery.
Each document class structures papers differently: some are format-
ted in single-column, others in double-column; different margins
or fonts are used; author names, abstracts or page numbers are
displayed differently.

Given a scientific article in PDF format, determining its docu-
ment class has several applications. First, systems for information
extraction over scholarly articles (such as GROBID [14] for meta-
data extraction or TheoremKB [15] for extraction of mathematical
statements) could benefit of knowing the document class to train
better models: it is easier to know how to extract section headings,

author’s institutions or statements of theorems when the document
class if known and all these elements are formatted similarly from
one article to the next. Second, academic search engines such as
Google Scholar1 or BASE Search2, which index PDF articles found
in preprint repositories and on the Web at large could derive in-
formation about where a document was published (e.g., that it is
published at an ACM or IEEE venue) based on its document class.
However, determining the document class of a scientific article is
far from trivial. Indeed, we often only have access to a PDF version
of the paper, and not to its LATEX source code. It is true that it may be
easy for a human being familiar with the various famous document
classes to determine, given only the PDF of the paper, the document
class used. However, this manual method cannot be scaled up to the
use cases above. This motivates the current work, which explores
automatic inference of the document class of a given scientific
article in PDF.

There is a relatively rich literature on information extraction
from scholarly articles. For instance, there is previous work on
extraction of headers and meta-data [1, 6, 14], citations [19], ac-
knowledgments [11] or figure meta-data [3].3 The exploitation of
the layout and visual rendering of PDF documents to make in-
ference about their content or structure has also been considered
[10, 22, 23], especially for applications such as extraction of data
from invoice-type documents. However, to the best of our knowl-
edge, the specific task of LATEX document class inference from PDF
articles has not been addressed to this date.

The goal of this work is to propose relatively simple, scalable,
tractable, and effective methods to achieve this classification task.
We propose a supervised machine learning approach to this classifi-
cation problem, each class corresponding to one (or several related)
document class(es). A first idea is to engineer discriminant features
based on some simple geometric and style-based characteristics
of the document. A second idea is to rely on the rendering of the
PDF document as a bitmap image and use standard modern image
classification techniques. Indeed, these are the two methods de-
scribed in this paper: using a set of simple, hand-coded document
style features; and using computer-vision methods relying on deep
learning.

In Section 2, we present the methodology used to construct a
set of five, simple, hand-coded document style features, based on
human knowledge of the structuring of scientific publications. In
Section 3, we introduce a more advanced model based on convolu-
tional neural networks (CNNs) [7, 12]; we also identify the presence
of so-called heterogeneous classes of documents, and the interest

of using reject options [9]. In Section 4, we discuss our dataset, as
well as performance metrics used to analyze our results. Finally,
we presents experimental results for both approaches in Sections 5
and 6, before concluding with perspectives for future work.

cially a list of all labels and detailed experimental results) is avail-

2 CLASSIFICATION ON HAND-CODED

FEATURES

In this section, we discuss the method developed to infer the LATEX
document class with only five, sample, hand-coded, document style
features.

In order to construct our set of features, we generate an XML
4, which
representation of each paper, thanks to a tool called pdfalto
automatically reconstructs a structured line-based representation
of a PDF document. More precisely, pdfalto is a tool for parsing PDF
files and producing an XML representation of the PDF content in
the ALTO5 standard format, with information about page geometry,
individual text tokens and lines, font styles, etc.

2.1 Hand-Coded Document Style Features
Before going into the technical details of the definition of features,
let us motivate our choice of variables. We follow two main goals.
First, we want to investigate whether a classification approach is
relevant, i.e., that feature values have different distributions per
different document class and thus make the data separable. Second,
we want to validate that an approach based on geometry is relevant,
which paves the way for the CNN model presented in Section 3.
This is why we chose to construct a set of five simple, human-
understandable, geometric features. The idea of each feature took
birth through human observation of scientific papers, and through
the prior knowledge that we have about how scientific papers are
usually organized.

We thus want to exploit: left margins of text blocks (1), top
margins on each page (2), the width of text columns (3), as well as
font families and font sizes used. A graphical illustration of the first
three of these elements is shown in Figure 1.

However, each of these elements is presented in multiple copies
in the document. Indeed, a scientific article almost always include
several blocks of text, several pages and several fonts. Therefore, it
is necessary to build aggregated features composed of the different
instances of the elements presented above. We now present our
five features.

Weighted average left margin (lm). The average is weighted
by text-block length, in order to obtain the most representative
value for the left margin. Let us denote 𝑚h
𝑖 the left margin of the
𝑖-th text-block of the document and 𝑙𝑖 its vertical height. Then, the

Antoine Gauquier and Pierre Senellart

Figure 1: Illustration of major geometric elements: 1/ left
margin; 2/ top margin; 3/ column width

weighted average left margin 𝑚h is defined as:

𝑚h =

𝑁𝑏
(cid:205)
𝑖=1

𝑚h

𝑖 × 𝑙𝑖

𝑁𝑏
(cid:205)
𝑖=1

𝑙𝑖

where 𝑁𝑏 denotes the number of text-blocks in the document. This
is a numerical feature (floating-point number).

Average first top margin (tm). We are here interested in the
gap between the top of the page and the very first block of content
(and not between the top of the page and all blocks of content). By
denoting 𝑚v
𝑖,𝑗 the distance between the top of the page and the 𝑗-th
block of the 𝑖-th page of the document, the average first top margin
𝑚v is defined as:

𝑁𝑝
(cid:205)
𝑖=1

min𝑗 𝑚v
𝑖,𝑗

𝑁𝑝

𝑚v =

where 𝑁𝑝 denotes the number of pages in the document. Again
here, this feature is numerical (floating-point number).

Weighted average column width (cw). Technically, it cor-
responds to the average of the width of every text block in the
document, weighted by the height of the block (so as not to put
importance on very short blocks, such as equations or sections
headings, which do not have a typical width). We here denote 𝑤𝑖
the width of the 𝑖-th text-block in the document, and 𝑙𝑖 its vertical
height. The weighted average column-width 𝑤 is defined as:

𝑁𝑏
(cid:205)
𝑖=1

𝑤𝑖 × 𝑙𝑖

𝑤 =

𝑁𝑏
(cid:205)
𝑖=1
where 𝑁𝑏 is still the number of text-blocks in the document. Note
this is very similar to the definition of lm. It is also a numerical
feature (floating-point number).

𝑙𝑖

Most common font family (ff). Choosing the most common
font family requires defining a criterion. We choose to quantify
the importance of a font family by the space it occupies in the
document. Assume we have 𝑁𝑓 different fonts used in the document
(in the ALTO representation, this corresponds to the number of
<TextStyle> tags). Let us denote 𝑆𝑖 the set of all tokens in the

123Automatically Inferring the Document Class of a Scientific Article

document styled in the 𝑖-th font of the document. We define the
font importance 𝑓𝑖 of the 𝑖-th font as:

respect to heterogeneous document classes, as well as a potential
solution.

𝑓𝑖 =

𝑙𝑠 × ℎ𝑠

(cid:205)
𝑠 ∈𝑆𝑖

𝑁𝑓
(cid:205)
𝑗=1

(cid:205)
𝑠 ∈𝑆 𝑗

𝑙𝑠 × ℎ𝑠

where 𝑙𝑠 is the length of token 𝑠, and ℎ𝑠 the height of token 𝑠. The
product 𝑙𝑠 × ℎ𝑠 thus gives an area, and we compute the space ratio
that each font family occupies. To finally get the most common
font-family 𝑓 family, we take the font family of the font with the
highest 𝑓𝑖 :

𝑓 family = family

(cid:32)

arg max

𝑖 ∈ {1,...,𝑁𝑓 }

(cid:33)

𝑓𝑖

.

This feature is a categorical one.

Most common font size (fs). The computation is based on the
computation 𝑓𝑖 defined above for each font 𝑖, and then we obtain
the feature

(cid:32)

𝑓 size = size

(cid:33)

arg max

𝑖 ∈ {1,...,𝑁𝑓 }

𝑓𝑖

.

This is a numerical value, though in practice it mostly acts as a
categorical feature as the number of different font sizes is limited.

2.2 Random Forest Model
We train a supervised machine learning model based on these five
features per document. After trying different models such as Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVM) [4] or logistic regression, we settled
on using random forests [2]. Random forests have the advantage of
giving good classification results on this kind of task (as we experi-
mented compared to SVMs and logistic regression), are reasonably
fast to train, and lend themselves well to explanations.

In more detail, models based on random forests are a type of
ensemble methods. The principle of ensemble methods is to com-
bine multiple weak learners (i.e., models whose performance is not
considered as being good enough) in order to have a global model
with good performance. The weak learners of random forests are
decision trees. On each node of the tree, a condition (usually, an
inequality) over one feature of the data is evaluated. Depending on
the answer, a branch is followed, and either leads to another node
(and thus, another evaluation), or a leaf, corresponding to one of
the possible classes. The random forest is thus composed of a set of
decision trees (also called estimators), each of them being trained
with a different subset of the data. The random forest provides
the data to be classified to all the estimators, and finally makes a
majority vote to decide which class is to be selected.

3 CNN-BASED APPROACH
In this section, we present an alternative approach, based on convo-
lutional neural networks, trained on a bitmap rendering of the PDFs.
We first explain which bitmap images are selected as input to the
model. We then present the general composition of a CNN, as well
as a sample simple architecture. We subsequently describe other
standard architectures we train, as well as their complexity through
two criteria. Finally, we discuss a limitation of the modeling with

3.1 Input to the Model
In order to use CNNs on PDF renderings, we need to decide which
exact content to show to the model. A natural idea is to simply
transform each page of the PDF into an image, by choosing a fixed
resolution and size for each image, so that the input size of the
model is the same for all papers, no matter the original format
of the paper. This of course has for consequence to distort the
aspect ratio of the PDFs, but it still preserves their structure and
organization on the page.

Convolutional neural networks are particularly suited for our
task, since they perform well in image processing and geometric
pattern learning through the use of convolution, while limiting
the number of parameters to be trained (in comparison with fully
connected, feed-forward, neural networks). However, they do not
support the observation of sequential data (in our case, a sequence
of images from the PDF paper) as RNNs or transformers do, so we
decided to only keep one image per paper, namely the rendering of
the very first page of the paper, since it contains much information
that can be used to discriminate document classes: position and
size of the title, of the author’s names, of the abstract, of copyright
statements, etc. Some document classes even have some specific
content in a header or footer.

An example of such an image, at the exact resolution that we
use in experiments and which is taken randomly from our dataset,
is shown in Figure 2. Note that, though the text is illegible, much in-
formation about the structure, geometry, and style of the document,
which are helpful to determine the document class, is apparent.

3.2 Design of a Simple Architecture
Convolutional Neural Networks [7, 12] are a deep learning tech-
nique involving an input layer, an output layer, and at least one
hidden layer. As opposed to fully connected layers of other forms
of neural networks, CNN uses convolutional layers, based on the
convolution operation. Denoted ∗, it is defined, in its discrete form
in two dimensions, which is the one we are interested in, as:

(𝑓 ∗ 𝑔)𝑚,𝑛 =

+∞
∑︁

+∞
∑︁

𝑖=−∞

𝑗=−∞

𝑓𝑖,𝑗 × 𝑔𝑚−𝑖,𝑛− 𝑗

where 𝑓 is the kernel or filter, and 𝑔 is the 2D input. For numerical
applications, 𝑓 and 𝑔 are finite.

The parameters of the model consists in the values of the 𝑓
matrices. We can have several filters per hidden layer, as well as
several hidden layers. In addition to these convolution operations,
we also apply a set of other operations, such as: activation func-
tions, to know which convolutional neurons are activated by the
parameters; pooling operations, to progressively reduce the size
of the images through the hidden layers and to get a small set of
embeddings at the end of the model; and dropout operations, which
aim at randomly dropping some of the neurons to avoid overfitting.
We then concatenate several of these layers, and finally add a
flattening operation and one (or several) last fully-connected layer,
to transform our set of small matrices of embeddings into a set of
logits, corresponding to the number of classes in our problem.

It is important to consider these two criteria in order to check
that our model is respectively simple, light (thus, that its number
of parameters is limited and that it takes little space in memory),
as well as fast, in training phase, but especially in inference phase:
it is an essential criterion so that the model can be scaled up.

3.4 Modeling with Reject Option
As mentioned in the introduction, LATEX includes several standard
document classes (including article, book, and report). In fact,
these are still widely used because they are guaranteed to be in-
stalled on any LATEX distribution, and because authors are used to
them. Indeed, it is very common to find articles with widely differ-
ent styles that have been written using these classes (chosen “by
default”) and numerous extra LATEX packages to customize the style.
This is in contrast with document classes developed by publishers,
which are usually followed quite strictly.

We can thus expect some difficulties in determining the docu-
ment class of a paper, when there is too much heterogeneity in
documents produced using them. As an alternative to the modeling
proposed so far, we consider an approach allowing us to put apart
these so-called heterogeneous classes, in order to potentially improve
the performance of our classifier on non-heterogeneous classes.

The idea of judging a subset of a dataset as “irrelevant” for a
machine learning model is something that has already been studied
under the name of classification with reject option [9]. The name
comes from the idea that we want our model to be able to reject a
prediction (or a training sample, considering training phase) if it
belongs to the irrelevant subset of our data (of course with respect
to the classification task we are considering).

There are two main kinds of reject options: novelty rejection
and ambiguity rejection. In the first case, the model receives an
unobserved sample that is significantly dissimilar to what has been
seen during training phase; in the second case, the learned model
does not behave correctly in certain regions of the instance space
it is evolving in. The idea of separating the heterogeneous classes
from the other ones is closer to the first type of rejection: the model
is observing, in inference phase, papers associated to one of the
heterogeneous classes having a structure which is too dissimilar
with the ones of this class on training phase. However, it is also
linked to ambiguity rejection, because a paper with completely
personalized structure from a heterogeneous class could be equally
distant from several document classes.

In order to keep a simple modeling, and since we expect the
task of distinguishing heterogeneous classes to be hard, we stick to
novelty rejection, and we propose an architecture that uses a sepa-
rate rejector, i.e., having one dedicated model for rejection, and one

Figure 2: Example of a generated image from a paper, taken
randomly in the dataset

As a sample simple architecture (but see following section for
more complex ones), we designed, in a fairly typical way for simple
CNNs, a simple model with four hidden layers, with increasing
numbers of filters and decreasing size of the embeddings throughout
the layers. Its architecture is presented in Figure 3.

3.3 Comparison with Other Architectures
Our assumption is that our simple architecture is sufficient to dis-
criminate document classes since, as already mentioned above, first
images of papers contain an important number of possible patterns
indicative of document classes. To verify this assumption, we also
train some more complex architectures from the state of the art.
Thus, we also consider the following ones: a 50-layer ResNet from
2016 [8], a Mobile version of NASNet from 2018 [24], and a B0
version of EfficientNetV2 from 2021 [20]. These are chosen because
they are standard CNN architectures and have a reasonably limited
number of parameters. We pay special attention to EfficentNetV2-
B0, first because it is the most recent of the considered architectures,
and second because it was designed to propose better parameter
efficiency than previous models. We set aside even more modern
architectures with a large number of parameters, such as the Con-
vNeXt architecture of 2022 [13], whose basic model nearly reaches
90 million parameters.

To be able to compare the complexity of these different models,
we present in Table 1 the total number of parameters of each archi-
tecture, as well as the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs)
required for inference (as defined in [21]), for the same (fixed) size
of input images, which is a machine-independent way to measure
the time for inference.

dedicated model for classification. The samples that are classified by
the rejector as too heterogeneous are not presented to the classifier.
A diagram showing this overall process is presented in Figure 4.
The architectures of each of the models (both rejector and classifier)
are close to the one presented in Section 3.2: we only modified the
last dense layer to be consistent with the tasks we do (respectively,
binary classification and multi-class classification with 31 possible
classes). We also added one dense layer for the rejector before the
last dense layer to help it discriminate heterogeneous classes.

4 DATASET AND PERFORMANCE METRICS
In this section, we present the dataset we are using to conduct our
experiments, as well as some (usual) performance metrics used to
evaluate our trained models.

4.1 Dataset
To conduct our experiments, we used a set of 119 087 scientific
papers, extracted from the ArXiv6 platform, a free open access
archive of scientific publications. This set of papers corresponds
to all papers from the year 2018. The choice of this platform is
justified by the joint availability of the PDF document and its LATEX

Figure 5: Selection process of papers

source, both of which can be obtained through arXiv’s bulk ac-
cess from AWS7. The document class is extracted from the LATEX
source through simple rules based on regular expressions. However,
among the 119 087 papers, only 98 713 could be exploited. Indeed,
for some of them, the LATEX source is missing, for example in the
case where the paper was written using word processing software
such as Microsoft Word, making it impossible to infer any docu-
ment class. For others, document class extraction was ambiguous
or impossible (e.g., some authors use Plain TEX instead of LATEX or
redefine the \documentclass macro), or the extraction of ALTO
or image representations was not possible (because of failures of
pdfalto or of the bitmap rendering); for more on arXiv extraction
issues, see [5, Section 6.2]. A diagram summarizing these steps is
shown in Figure 5.

Within these remaining 98 713 documents, we identify more
than 1 200 different document classes (based on their names). But
we observe that an overwhelming majority of papers correspond
to only a few classes. Indeed, the first 20 classes represent 90%
of the papers, and more than half of document classes are only
used in one paper. In order to be able to use statistical learning
methods, we need enough data for each class so that the models
can be properly trained. We therefore impose a criterion of data
representativeness, namely that each class kept must contain at least
one thousandth of the data (thus appearing in around one hundred
articles). 44 document classes satisfy this criterion. As article, the
most commonly used class, was also the one that was the most

6https://arxiv.org/

7https://info.arxiv.org/help/bulk_data_s3.html

heterogeneous, we renamed that class to other and mapped all
documents whose class was not among the 44 to that class. This
means the other class partly act as a reject option, though we also
consider a better rejection strategy as detailed in Section 6.

The reduced list of 44 classes still contain very similar classes (as
can directly be observed by name similarities). For example, classes
aastex6, aastex61 and aastex62; ieeeconf and ieeetran; or
amsart and amsproc. It is therefore likely that some classes are
in fact very similar, but a similarity in name only is not enough to
justify merging these classes. We could also miss similar classes
whose names are too different to predict that they are similar. To
properly deal with similar document classes with different names,
we compute a similarity metric between the source codes of the
.cls document classes, usually available within the arXiv source
archive.

We chose term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)
[18], which evaluates, for a given document class, the importance
of each term in the source code of that class. We therefore compute
a vector whose size is the number of distinct terms and associates
to each term an importance score. Once those scores are computed
for all document classes, we can compute a pairwise similarity, by
computing, for all pairs of document classes (𝑖, 𝑗) with 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 the
dot product of their TF-IDF vectors. This results in a score between
0 and 1, representing how similar the pair of document classes is.
We set a threshold of 0.8.

By applying this rule, we have a new short-list of 33 classes,
corresponding to individual or groups of document classes, which
is our final label set for the different approaches.

We split our dataset between a train and a test set, by randomly
selecting papers for each class with a ratio of 0.8 (80% of the dataset
for training, and 20% of the dataset for test).

The dataset is heavily unbalanced across document classes: the
biggest class other has 31 759 samples, while some others have just
above 100 instances. To deal with this while training our models, we
use oversampling techniques [16]. For each of the 32 classes except
other, we randomly duplicate papers to reach the same number of
samples as class other. We do this within the training set so as to
do unbiased training across classes; this allows the model to pay
as much attention to each of the classes, but also to show more
data to the model, thus ensuring its convergence and stability. We
also perform oversampling over the test set, in order to properly
measure its performance, as described next.

4.2 Performance Metrics
We define performance metrics to evaluate and compare our re-
sults on the test set. Global accuracy of the classification over the
entire test set is not sufficient as we want to investigate in more
detail misclassification errors. We therefore report the individual
precision, recall, and F1-score of the classification for every class (in
the extended version of this paper) and their mean (as a summary),
which will be unaffected by data imbalance.

Let us denote TP𝑖 the number of “true positives” for class 𝑖, i.e.,
the number of samples that the model classifies in class 𝑖 and that
actually belong to this class. TN𝑖 will then be the number of “true
negatives” for class 𝑖, i.e., the samples that were rejected by the
model (for a multi-class problem, it corresponds to the situation

where a model classified the sample not to belong to class 𝑖, so
basically to any other class), while actually not belonging to this
class 𝑖. We also define FP𝑖 as the number of “false positives” for
class 𝑖, which is the number of samples that the model classifies
in class 𝑖 while belonging to another class. Finally, we define FN𝑖
the number of “false negatives” for class 𝑖, which correspond to the
samples that are rejected by the model for class 𝑖 but that do belong
to this class 𝑖.

The precision score of a given class 𝑖 is defined as follows:

precision𝑖 =

TP𝑖
TP𝑖 + FP𝑖

The recall score of a given class 𝑖 is defined as follows:

recall𝑖 =

TP𝑖
TP𝑖 + FN𝑖

And the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean on of both precision
and recall, is defined as follows:

F1-score𝑖 = 2

precision𝑖 × recall𝑖
precision𝑖 + recall𝑖

Note that per-class recall is the same as per-class accuracy: the
proportion of documents of this class that are correctly classified.
Precision, recall, and F1-score are then summarized across all

classes by their unweighted arithmetic mean.

5 EXPERIMENTS FOR HAND-CODED

FEATURES

In this section, we present the data distribution and experimental
results obtained with the five hand-coded document style features
described in Section 2 and the random forests model built on top of
them.

5.1 Data Distribution
We analyze the distribution of feature values on the entire dataset
of 98 713 articles described in Section 4. Table 2 presents some
key figures about the distribution of the data, for all the numerical
features (i.e., all except ff).

Weighted average left margin (lm). Figure 6 shows the plot
of the histogram for this feature. As with all other histogram charts
(Figures 7 to 9), the 𝑥-axis represents the values taken by the feature
(i.e., here, the value in points8), and the 𝑦-axis the corresponding
frequency (as a number between 0 and 1, summing up to 1) of the
range values referenced by the histogram bar. We observe what
seems to be the superposition of two Gaussian-like distributions:
the first with a mean close to 140 and the other one with a mean

72 -th of an inch.

close to 190 (some common document classes such as llncs or

Average first top margin (tm). Figure 7 shows the plot of the
histogram for this feature. We can also observe a Gaussian-like
distribution of the data, around the value 90, with an important
peak at approximately 40 points.

Weighted average column width (cw). Figure 8 shows the
plot of the histogram for this feature. By observing the shape of the
histogram, we again identify what seems to be the superposition of
two Gaussian-like distributions: one with mean around 200 points,
and one around 300 points. Given the fact that the width of a page
is usually around 600 points9, and that some space is kept for mar-
gins, these two distributions most likely respectively correspond to
papers with two columns (smaller column widths) and one column
(larger column widths).

This tends to show that the column-width represents papers
with two or one columns: the papers with two columns are more
likely to have smaller horizontal margins than papers with a single
column.

9More precisely, 612 points for US letter and approximately 595 for ISO 216 A4.

Most common font family (ff). This feature is different from
the other ones, since it is categorical. We cannot describe it with con-
tinuous, numerical metrics, but the histogram presented in Figure 9
is sufficient to correctly describe its distribution. It is important
to note that we have not displayed all possible font-families, since
there are 109 of them, and that would have become impossible to
read. In the histogram, we only show font families that have at
least 100 representatives (samples that take this value). The rest
is put together in a class “All others”. We see that we only have a
few significant font families in terms of frequency (the three most
frequent being cmr, i.e., the default Computer Modern font family
of TEX; nimbusromnol, i.e., Nimbus Roman No.9 L, a free serif font
designed to have the same metrics as Times New Roman; and sfrm,
the Computer Modern font from the CM-Super family which is a re-
design of TEX’s classic Computer Modern font). Other font families
may still be important to identify specific document classes.

Most common font size (fs). Figure 10 shows the plot of the
histogram for this feature. We observe here that, despite the fact
that it is a numerical feature, we could consider it a categorical one.
This is due to the fact that the font sizes associated with the most

Antoine Gauquier and Pierre Senellart

frequent class would have an accuracy of 31 759
it would have a mean recall of 1
32×0+1/33
33

Note that a Dummy classifier which would predict the most
98712 ≈ 32.2% while
33 ≈ 3.03%, a mean precision of
≈ 0.09%, and F1-score of ≈ 0.18%. This illustrates the
importance of considering these three metrics instead of just using
global accuracy, and this means the random forest model very
significantly outperforms the Dummy classifier.

We observe that some classes are really well classified, on which
the model generalizes well. We can cite the document class bmvc2k
which has perfect scores in training, and around 97% in test. We
identify other classes well classified by the model, such as cms,
eptcs, iau/jfm, lipics, mdpi, sigma or wbofc. This shows that
the classification approach is relevant for the data we are interested
in, since the model succeeds in classifying an important number of
classes very well (i.e., the features are such that the data belonging
to those classes are easily separable).

But we also identify some classes that are very poorly classified.
In particular, two classes have performance in test (for at least one
metric) which is similar or even worse than a dummy classifier.
Those classes are other and book. This is not very surprising, as
these document classes, as previously discussed are very hetero-
geneous. Indeed, heterogeneous classes are particularly hard to
classify using our random forest model.

Remaining classes have performance that vary from around 25%

up to 85% for the different metrics.

Those results are particularly encouraging, since we must keep
in mind that we are doing a hard classification task, on 33 classes.
Thus, even classes with performance metrics around 25% are way
above the results of the dummy classifier. Moreover, this is only
using five hand-designed features, chosen from the prior knowledge
we have about the domain. This proves that not only a classification
approach is justified and relevant for this task, but also that using
geometric and style features is relevant.

We consider the importance of features used in the random for-
est model, a measure that quantifies how much each feature on
average reduces entropy of the distribution averaged over all nodes
of the forest. The feature with highest impact is tm, with 32.7% of
importance, then lm with 19.3% of importance, ff 18.4%, cw 16.5%,
and fs has 13.1%. All features thus had some non-negligible impact
on the result of the classifier.

6 EXPERIMENTS USING CNN MODELS
In this section, we present the results of the training of the several
CNNs we presented in Section 3. We first compare the results of
our simple architecture from Section 3.2 with the ones from the
literature described in Section 3.3; then we present results related
to the modeling with reject option of Section 3.4.

6.1 Results of the CNN Architectures
The training of each CNN model requires specifying some parame-
ters for the image generation part. We recall that each input image
has a fixed size. We set this to 256×256. Each image is converted to
256-level grayscale, so each image weighs 256 × 256 × 1 = 64 kB.
We report the mean performance (precision, recall, and F1-score)
across all classes, as defined in Section 4.2. The average perfor-
mance (mean precision, recall and F1-Score, as defined in section 4)

common fonts are usually 9, 10 (TEX’s default font size), 11, or 12
points, with very few exceptions.

Correlation of features with each other are presented in the
Table 3. Note the strong (negative) correlation between the cw and
lm which is intuitive: a document with small column width will
have high left margin, for a fixed number of columns.

5.2 Results of the Random Forest Model
We now report on the results of the random forest model. The
use of random forests in practice requires making some choices
in terms of hyperparameter. The first one to be considered is the
minimum number of samples per leaf in the decision trees. In fact,
since we have important heterogeneity in our data, and given the
quite high number of classes, there is a high risk of overfitting if
we let this parameter free (i.e., no minimum number of samples
per leaf: we could end up only having one sample per leaf). In fact,
without setting this one, we ended up having 100% of accuracy
on the training set (classes being now balanced), but low global
accuracy on the test set (around 40%). We set this parameter to be
0.01% of total observed samples. The second such parameter is the
number of estimators (i.e., the number of decision trees involved
in the forest). We set it to 1 000; the default value is 100, but this
would low for a 33-class classification process and might impact
the stability of the most common decision. We used the random
forest implementation of the scikit-learn [17] Python library.

By training such a model with these parameters, we got, on the
training set, a global accuracy of 87.6%, and of 66.0% on the test set.
The mean precision is 64%, recall 66%, and F1-Score 64%, all on the
test set.

The best performance is obtained with the most recent CNN ar-

ever, all models have similar performance, roughly within 1% of the
performance of EfficientNetV2B0, all achieving a very high mean
precision and recall across classes, significantly above that of the
random forest approach with hand-coded features of Sections 2
and 5.

6.2 Results of Modeling with Reject Option
Now that we have trained our CNN architecture with the 33 classes,
we can check whether the classes article (included in class other),
report (included in class report/wlscirep) and book have bad
classification performance, because of their heterogeneous nature.
Their precision, recall, and F1-Score on our simple CNN architecture
are shown in Table 5.

Indeed, the performance of these three classes is the worst across
all classes (the next-worst classes have F1-score above 87%). This
validates the need for using a rejector to discriminate between
homogeneous and heterogeneous classes. First, Table 6 presents
the number of parameters and FLOPs for both rejector and classi-
fier. Performance of both rejector and classifier after rejection, as
described in Section 3.4 are presented in Table 7.

The performance metrics show that removing the heterogeneous
classes from the classifier allows it to perform even better, since we

gain 4.5% of F1-Score in comparison with our modeling including
heterogeneous classes. However, the overall pipeline will perform
worse than the first CNN modeling, due to the lower F1-Score of
the rejector: even if we had a perfect classifier after rejection, we
would still have an overall F1-Score for the whole pipeline below
90%.

Lower performance does not mean that this modeling is useless.
In fact, it may be particularly useful when it comes to processing
articles which are known not to belong to heterogeneous classes.
Indeed, from Table 8, which presents the detailed performance met-
rics of the rejector, we see that the recall for non-heterogeneous
document classes is above 98%. In practice, it means that less than
2% of papers belonging to non-heterogeneous classes are classified
as heterogeneous classes. Since we have a near-perfect recall for
the non-heterogeneous document classes, most of them will be pre-
sented to the classifier, which has above 96% of F1-Score, resulting
in very high overall classification performance. This can be used
in some important use cases. For instance, if we are interested in
determining the publisher of a given published (scientific) scholarly
article (say, whether it is ACM, IEEE, Schloß Dagstuhl, etc.), it will
usually be part of some non-heterogeneous document class; the
approach with reject option will allow us to detect outliers while
reaching near-perfect classification performance for documents of
those publishers.

7 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we consider the task of inferring the document class of
a PDF scientific article, through the use of classifiers. The first one is
a random forest classifier trained on five hand-coded document style
features. It is giving satisfactory results considering the number of
document classes we are dealing with, but the other model based
on computer-vision approaches (through the use of CNNs) gives
significantly better results, whatever the choice of the precise CNN
architecture (a simple one as proposed in the paper or some state-
of-the-art architectures). We note that CNNs do require more (GPU)
computation power for training and inference than the random
forest approach. Moreover, a prediction of the random forest model
is relatively easily explainable, and can be related to the decision a

human being would make. This is not directly possible with CNNs,
which mostly act as a “black box”, hard to explain.

The approach proposed in this paper can be applied to a num-
ber of tasks, as hinted to in the Introduction, from inferring some
publication meta-information from a PDF found on the Web to the
use of the knowledge of the document class to improve techniques
aiming at extracting information from the PDF of articles. A natural
perspective for this work is to assess the usefulness of document
class inference for such tasks.

We must keep in mind that the entire study was done on PDFs
from a specific dataset: papers published in 2018 on the arXiv which
had LATEX sources available. This means only specific fields, those
common on arXiv, are represented, and thus only specific document
classes. Also, evolution of document classes before and after that
date are not captured. As a consequence, the set of document classes
we considered in this paper might not correspond to the set of
most common document classes we might encounter in the wild,
even only considering scientific articles. We note however that we
are unaware of any other labeled dataset with readily available
document class information.
